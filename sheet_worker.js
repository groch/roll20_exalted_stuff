Naming it off limits, she fires a scintillating shot high into the air. Her arrow flies up and up and does not come down unless the opponent crosses through, over, or into the designated position, at which point they become subject to a decisive attack with the Solar’s unmodified attack pool, and with damage equal to the Initiative she had the moment she fired the shot. In addition , this shot is enhanced by the prerequisite at no extra charge. If Hanging Judgment Arc succeeds at damaging the target, the Solar’s Initiative does not return to base. If the Exalt is crashed, slain, or the scene ends without the attack being triggered, the arrow comes down and will set fire to any flammable thing it touches. Any use of this Charm must occur in places with enough vertical space to fire an arrow upward without it getting lodged in the ceiling. The player can’t threat-mark an area inside an enclosed building or chamber while standing outside. Special activation rules: If the Lawgiver threatens a specific character with this attack, (ie “Winglord Kvetu may not retreat across that bridge”) the attack gains [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic successes, [[@{essence}]](Essence) bonus dice, and [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic damage successes. At Archery 5+, Essence 3+, the Lawgiver may use this Charm out of combat for eight motes, setting the Charm’s duration to Indefinite, and giving it a base damage of 17. With Archery 5+ Essence 4+, the out-of-combat use becomes Stackable up to [[@{essence}]](Essence) times. These bans do not end if the Solar is crashed or slain, only if the threat is triggered or the Lawgiver ends her commitment. On Hanging Judgment Arc The backer had a really awesome name and idea for an Archery Charm, but execution was trickier than it looked. In case you are wondering, if you mark an area where your ally is standing when an enemy triggers the attack, the attack is precise enough to only hit the enemy . But whether or not they both catch on fire is a totally different issue.

The shot lands without a roll, and everything at close range to the arrow is subject to an explosion that can’t be parried, only dodged. The explosion has an attack pool of the Solar’s Initiative (maximum 10 dice), and rolls decisive damage equal to the Solar’s Initiative. If this attack is successful against at least one enemy, then it resets the Solar’s Initiative to base. It can expressly be used to blow up inanimate objects, scenery, and siege weaponry without affecting the Solar’s Initiative. All characters struck by this attack are knocked out of the exploded range band and land prone, losing one Initiative each, not transferred to the Solar. Characters blown down by this Charm have no control over where they land; characters who dodge this explosion are automatically knocked to the next range band, but they do not lose Initiative nor do they fall to prone, simply rolling to their feet or skidding along on their heels without losing balance. If used to damage a battle group, Nova Arrow Attack causes disarray and panic, applying a -2 success penalty to its next attack. On Nova Arrow Attack The natural evolution of Fiery Arrow Attack, I wanted to do this Charm originally, but was too pressed for time to come up with a balanced explosion mechanic.

Characters within short range of this arrow can feel their slightest movement causing it to agitate and surge with Solar anima; their barest shifts in posture threaten to cause an explosion. If it explodes, Hell-Heeling Arrow will hit everything in short range, and the only way to escape it is to successfully disengage — once if at short range, twice if at close. The difficulty of this roll is 5. If any character simply moves a range band (or gets moved), the arrow explodes, doing a non-standard decisive attack to all targets with an attack pool of (Essence + Initiative) dice (maximum 12), with a damage pool of (Initiative) dice. The blast from this explosion can only be dodged, and has the same knockdown rules as Nova Arrow Attack. In addition, characters knocked down by this attack are automatically lit on fire, suffering bonfire (4L/round) damage until they can put it out. Hell-Heeling Arrow does not reset the Solar’s Initiative to base. It can only be used once per battle, but may be reset by joining battle.

Where this arrow strikes, it will send out a line of burning destruction, one range band for every five Initiative (rounded up). Everything caught in this burning nova swath takes damage; characters are subject to a high intensity (6L/round) bonfire, while scenery takes fiat levels of damage. A character struck with this attack is likewise flung backwards one range band for every three health levels lost from the attack. If a Solar uses this Charm against a ship made of natural materials, every three damage successes equals a point of hull damage. If she uses it against a battle group, they are automatically at -2 successes from their next rout check. Solar Judgment Flare can be used without an aim action. On Solar Judgment Flare The backer is brand new to Exalted, so I had to help him find the exact right Charm. The first couple of Resistance Charms we worked on didn’t feel right to his personality, so we scrapped them. Finally I asked him what characters he likes most, and he started to talk about an overpowered archer from Fate Stay/Night. I had known since the beginning that Archery yet needed an overpowered Charm, so I worked out this incredibly powerful mechanic. There may be yet be another upgrade to this Charm, one of unfathomable power.

Entries in a Solar’s scent library can be used to aid in Investigation and Survival rolls, as well as in the smell-based Awareness Charms further up the tree. This Charm also creates a taste index. Similar to the scent library, the taste index allows the Exalt to immediately recognize any taste she has experienced within the realm of reason. The Solar can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced most of the flavors at some point in time. The taste index isn’t populated the same way as the scent library; most characters do not have Major or Defining intimacies for flavors. Rather, the Solar may perfectly recognize any flavor the Storyteller considers reasonable. If the charac- ter has been a master chef all of her life, her palate is going to be considerably more robust than that of an islander with little contact with the outside world.

She can identify a familiar face in a pitch black crypt, but might need several activations to visualize the fossil skeleton of an ancient behemoth in a lightless cavern.

Sound from Stillness Meditation: For six motes, one Willpower, the Solar can take a Simple action lasting five minutes to filter Creation, listening for specific sounds or conversations that have already happened. The Exalt draws audio from the vibrations of sounds stored in her surroundings —usually rocks and trees—and may listen for noises or conversations that happened up to [[ @{essence} * 5 ]](Essence x5) hours prior to her arrival with a difficulty 5 Awareness roll.

This blow strikes with the force of a hurricane condensed into the Solar’s fist. The more damaging the blow, the more forcefully her opponent will be knocked away from her: For at least three successes, the opponent is lifted and bodily hurled into an object or surface within close range, hitting it with an impact equivalent to falling a short distance (see falling damage, p. 232), destroying any less-obdurate objects he collides with, such as wooden furniture. At four or more successes, the foe is knocked into an object at close range with tremendous force, or is sent sailing a remarkable distance by the force of the blow.

This code of honor must be reflected in the writing of the charter, and the charter itself must be made available to every member the Solar wishes to effect with this Charm. Members who read the charter, or have had it read to them by a superior, become aware of the imbued Intimacies and can choose to act as the Solar would, taking advantage of those Intimacies as if they possessed them. Such a member can, for example, cite the Solar’s Intimacy in a decision point when someone is trying to promote corruption in the ranks of the Exalt’s subordinates. The effects of this Charm last until the Solar alters the charter, and may even continue beyond her death. On Honor-Instilling Mantra The backer wanted a Bureaucracy Charm that would allow him to instill the organization’s members such that they would always act as the Solar would. I felt that was way too powerful. Mind-controlling hundreds of people with a single Charm defeats the purpose of social influence. Instead we came up with a Charm that allows members of an organization to consult the Solar’s vision of honor and leadership, creating a communal well of ethical and moral action to draw strength from. No one under the effect of this Charm is forced to abide by it, but there are undeniable benefits for those who do. Couple that with the power of the prerequisite and the Solar gains a very sharp understanding of what goes on in her offices while she is not there. Special thanks goes to Holden for the core mechanic of this Charm.

When activating the Charm, the Solar must be very specific about which kind of customers she will attract based on their Resources rating. The player can specify customers with “financial problems and Resources 5”, “multiple Resources 5 who need to deposit vast sums of money”, “a valuation inquiry and any Resources rating”, and so on. As long as the Solar’s net isn’t cast extremely wide, as soon as a person with the designated problem steps into the area affected by her Essence they will be drawn to her. Note that an arriving customer won’t exactly understand why they’ve been drawn to the Solar or how it was done. It’s up to the Solar to recognize the customer, figure out what their problem is, and impress them with her expertise and preeminence in all things commercial. Special activation rules: If the Solar knows the Larceny Charm Seasoned Criminal Method, the player may use this Charm to specify targets with “Larceny problems difficulty 1-5” or of one specific difficulty. The player may also combine specifications: “a subject with Resources 5 that has a difficulty 5 Larceny problem.” On Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit The backer’s favorite Caste is Eclipse, and their favorite Ability is Bureaucracy, so I decided to make them a very mystical, extremely useful Charm for Solars trying to operate in the shadow economy or who are simply trying to be very exclusive. Readers might be interested to know that the J.P. Morgan banking dynasty began with banking services catering only to the ultra rich, usually exclusively to trade organizations. They never advertised, and never opened up more than a single office in one country, and that exclusivity elevated them to a nigh-mythic stature. A Solar dealing in gigantic sums of capital, troubleshooting economic problems and providing legal services can become an even greater subject of myth, and even more sought after. This Charm also helps the Solar to protect herself, since direct advertisement or street-side storefronts aren’t always safe. Players should note that this Charm is bound to be more effective in busy trade districts of bustling cities. If you use this Charm in the dusty village of some half-dry desert watering hole, you might not have much luck attracting customers.

When it has passed, the coin between her fingers has become a coin of pure adamant, with the Unconquered Sun’s emblem on one side and the Solar’s sigil on the other. This coin has a number of properties and abilities. The Solar may give this coin to another, authorizing them to use it in the Solar’s name. Any ghost, god, or raksha who sees the coin will automatically recognize the bearer as a business agent of one of the Solar Exalted. Such beings gain automatic knowledge of the Solar’s full Resources rating, allowing the bearer to settle accounts and make purchases without an exchange of wealth. When the bearer makes such purchases on the Lawgiver’s behalf, the Adamant Specie represents a heavenly oath on the Solar’s behalf to pay the debt out of her standing Resources within a year and a day. If the target in this transaction is destroyed or makes it deliberately impossible for the Exalt to settle her account, the heavenly oath — but perhaps not the debt — is nullified. Mortal merchants have no power to recognize the accounts of the Solar Exalted at a glance, and Guildsmen are particularly well-trained in not accepting magicked coins. Demons, as participants in deliberately insurgent economies, recognize the Solar’s accounts but may always refuse to confer them credit. Ergo, neither demons nor Guildsmen honor such trade. Such a coin also has a number of other strange effects. For one, the bearer can travel through the bordermarches of the Wyld and as long as they are holding the coin, neither they nor the things they are wearing or carrying can be warped by the Wyld. The coin also evinces personal agency. If it is stolen, it can cause sudden cases of bad luck — 9s and 10s turned to 1s. To some it appears to give off a cursed silvery glow and they refuse to touch it. Others try to lift it and find that it is far beyond mortal strength to lift. In the open market, it has a way of getting mixed into local tender, riding commerce to the edges of the Solar’s reach. If taken up by someone who fits one of the specified criteria of Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit, the coin will lead that person to the Solar, even if they are at the far end of the city. Note that characters who are not authorized cannot use the coin to make purchases on the Solar’s account. Special activation rules: The Solar may only create one such coin per day, but may have up to [[@{essence}]](Essence) coins in circulation. She may at any time pay one mote reflexively to cause the magic to flee a coin, causing it to transform instantly into a dull lead coin with faded inscription. She may also will a coin back to herself, causing it to travel from person to person, riding transactions and turns of luck to make itself known to her so that she can reclaim it. This process usually takes five or six hours to complete. Less, if the Solar goes looking for it. If the Solar is slain, all of her adamant coins immediately lose their magic and turn to lead. On Creation of Adamant Specie A very strange and interesting Charm, particularly apt as it sits inside the Eclipse wheelhouse. This Charm also demonstrates how Solar Charms sometimes get a little inventive and outside-the-box at higher Essence, something I was hard-pressed to show while writing the framework of the design. The reason ghosts are an applicable target for this Charm is because ghosts are often fettered to the living world, and concerned with trade and transaction. Gods, as natural bureaucrats, also quite often find it very natural to wheel and deal. Both types of spirits adore worship, and so the loftier ideal of “credit” is something they can easily and very naturally grasp and work with. Demons are excluded from this triad for a number of reasons, from insurgent economy to slave caveat. What it boils down to is that a Yozi wants a Solar to conduct her business in person. The Lords of Chaos are however included because their existence is so often defined by relational trade with Creation. Raksha are simply “in the know” when it comes to doing business with their Solar enemies, and Solar magic accounts for them. And for those who are wondering, magical materials do not count as natural metals.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"bureaucracy":5,"essence":4},"prereq":["Infinitely-Efficient Register"],"charm-skill":"Bureaucracy","charm-name":"Spectacle-Inciting Order","charm-type":"Simple","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"8m","rep-cost-mote":8,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Solar : MotSE","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"If the Solar has established herself as a person of business renown in an area and has a practice or organization that is currently functioning, then she may use this Charm once per season to call a prestigious and strange package to be delivered to a local market or other place of public commerce .

In any case, the package is wrapped in glorious, scintillating, luminously textured paper, but is magically bound by a ribbon and can be opened by none other than the Solar. The package draws fascinated crowds and it is automatically perceived as something wondrous, a gift from the gods, or something strange and exciting. Roll the Solar’s unmodified Intelligence + Bureaucracy against a difficulty of 2 to determine the package’s Resources value.

Through repeated use of this Charm, and the eventual delivery of goods which are nigh priceless, the Solar can drive up speculation on the mysterious delivery and, on the fiction of never knowing the value of what’s inside, she can sell away something utterly worthless for a fortune, and can keep something priceless for herself, or use high Resources packages to entice future prospects into bigger gambling, business partnerships, and so on.

If used while under the effect of Craftsman Needs No Tools, this time is reduced to minutes or seconds, and eliminates both the need for tools and in many cases for materials. This Charm can restore magical objects but not metaphorical concepts: it cannot mend a broken heart, nor can it put the magic back into a First Age construct whose magic has fled or faded away. This Charm may lower the difficulty of repairing Artifacts that are fragmented or shattered, while also making such a repair possible, but otherwise does not remove the material requirements or affect the goal number.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"craft":5,"essence":1},"prereq":["Crack-Mending Technique"],"charm-skill":"Craft","charm-name":"Time Heals Nothing","charm-type":"Simple","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"4m, 1wp","rep-cost-mote":4,"rep-cost-will":1,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Ex3 Core","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"The Lawgiver can press aside the veil of time to deliver the world from its ravages.","charm-effect":"This Charm allows the Exalt to instantly create a major project slot for the purposes of repairs.

Upon using the Charm, the Solar’s player describes a retroactive continuity in which their Solar planned and built — or in some cases destroyed — the thing for just such an occasion. The sole limitation is that this plot device cannot simply resolve the conflict on its own. It can only be something that helps to make an unfair situation less inequitable. Special activation rules: The Solar must have at least 15+ silver points on hand to use this Charm. However, using this Charm requires no expenditure of craft experience . The finished project must reflect the Exalt’s chosen Craft Ability as well; a Solar with no skill as a seamstress cannot produce a ballgown to help an urchin look like a princess, nor can a Solar with no engineering skill reveal the location of a secret earthwork and palisade she built as a fallback position against the advancing Wyld Hunt. This Charm may only be used [[ ceil(@{essence}/2) ]](Essence / 2 round up) times per story. Lastly, if the player shows ingenuity or cleverness in their Solar’s invention, award them one silver and two gold points. If they devise something very witty, funny, or interesting — especially if it helps drive conflict — grant the Solar three gold and one white point. On Ever-Ready Innovation Discipline The backer requested a Charm for his Twilight mastermind , that would allow him to build a contingency plan through a flashback retcon. I decided to put it in Craft to help players insert a fresh opportunity to describe their character’s crafting efforts over time in a moment relevant to the scene at hand, essentially allowing them to bring their craftsmanship center stage. I stipulated that their labor couldn’t completely resolve the conflict because it made it easier to appreciate an act of Deus ex Anathema if the other players were allowed to get in on the action, as with a Solar who presents the Night Caste with a rickety hang-glider built from coastal ship-wreckage when she needs over the walls of Ostagul without actually touching them. Or the Solar who has revealed she’s dismantled three of the nine ballistae being wheeled up to the city gates — snapping her fingers and causing them to fall apart completely — so that the Dawn Caste can hold off the rest. Storytellers, if you feel like the plot device the player describes would resolve the conflict, feel free to reduce, alter, or damage it in some way to bring the conflict back into question. In addition, if you feel like there was absolutely no behind-the-scenes opportunity for the Exalt to finish the project they are describing, you can veto a use of this Charm. However, try to avoid doing this; if you can fathom the Exalt working into the wee hours working on her craft between all the other events in your story, allow it! Players need every opportunity to bring the long term (and therefore background) fruits of their labors into live, ongoing scenes. Examples in play:\n • As the Eclipse returns to port in her trireme, she is set upon by a number of enemy ships which lay ambush to her in the bay. As her Circle contemplates its options, the Twilight reveals a small ship — swift, sleek, and able — that will carry them to their comrade’s side.\n • An earthquake causes damage to thousands of expensive wheels of cheese, which will go bad if they are not used immediately, causing the economic collapse of an entire industry. The Solar chef produces a recipe for cheese soup that allows restaurateurs to buy the damaged wheels in increased volume, to attempt to save the industry from total collapse. See Projects on page 226 of Exalted.\n • A Lunar warlord-queen is sweet on the Dawn Caste, but if he makes an ass of himself at her feast the entire Circle is going to be kicked out of her dominion, and they badly need to remain there until their work is finished. Rather than trusting him to dress himself, the Zenith tailor presents a highly-stylized garment fit for royalty, so that the Circle’s fashion victim doesn’t get them exiled.\n • “What can be done about the Ten Thousand Wooden Soldiers of Andus Gouch?

Righteous Lion Defense allows the Exalt to treat any persuasion which would cause the Solar to act against the selected Principle as unacceptable influence. This effect may not be routed through principles that are overly broad. “I will never kneel,” is too broad, but “I will never kneel to Zhao Li,” is not. Likewise, “Creation must be conquered,” is too broad, while “Great Forks must be conquered” is not. The Solar’s zealous resolution daunts even the most relentless opposition.

If the subject is somewhere the Lawgiver has been, this Charm makes her aware of the subject’s whereabouts. If not, she gets a general sense of direction and [[ {@{essence},3}kh1 ]](greater of Essence or three) non-Charm successes to Awareness, Investigation, or Survival to find them. At Essence 4+, the cost of this Charm drops to three motes. Special activation rules: As long as the Solar has committed this Charm to at least one character, it automatically applies to every character that is bound to her through a magically powerful oath such as one produced through sorcery or the Eclipse anima power. On Empathic Aegis Discipline The backer asked for a Charm that would let him sense when his closest allies were in peril. For those of you who are wondering which Ability to use in order to find someone with this Charm, think of Awareness, Investigation, and Survival in terms of distances. If your friend has been tied, weighted, and thrown into a canal running through a busy city, you might be close enough — say, inside a nearby building — that upon emerging, you use Awareness Charms to hear their heartbeat at the bottom of the river, applying this Charm’s bonus to your attempt. But say they’re across the city, in a warehouse you’ve never seen, and someone is torturing them to reveal a secret. In that case, you would want to use Investigation Charms to try to find evidence of the abduction. But over a much larger distance, like a vast woodland, you would use Survival to track someone. Note that Awareness based Solar Charms are always helpful in noticing clues with Investigation or using Survival to see the minutest traces of a presence that has disturbed a natural environment.

In a decision point she may cite something precious that she lost in defense of a Principle she still holds. Perhaps she lost an eye or a limb, or had to let go of someone she loved in order to pursue the path she’s now on. In doing so, she can resolve the decision point without paying a point of Willpower, and without tapping a relevant Intimacy (if any even exist). This Charm can only be used once per story, but can be reset by successfully resisting influence regarding the defended Principle twice more. On Strength from Conviction Stance The backer wanted something weighty and emotionally charged — a Charm to help demonstrate the strength and courage of a tremendously dedicated individual who has endured suffering in the pursuit of their cause. This Charm is uncanny, because at a glance it appears simple, but it is a little more complicated than it seems, yet at the same time it’s very easy to grasp when looking backward from the social influence system. If you’re a little fuzzy on decision points, this Charm functions by modifying the rule on Exalted page 221, third paragraph under the “Overturning Influence” header, about overturning influence by citing what has come before. Only it expands the definition of what you are allowed to cite, and doesn’t require an Intimacy. (You might have lost a Tie when a loved one died, but did you have an Intimacy for your lost eye? Probably not.) It also doesn’t require that you be under the effect of an ongoing persuade action; it simply treats your Principle as if it has the weight of a legendary quest. It’s also recursive; by waiving your need to tap an Intimacy, you can cite the very same reasons the next time you fall into a decision point. You’ll have to pay the Willpower and come up with a new Intimacy if you fall into a third decision point, but I feel the second repetition helps it feel like the Solar’s Conviction is profound.

While this Charm greatly speeds the Solar’s efforts, it does not directly influence the mechanical speed with which she lays down words—her speed is increased by a streamlining of thought processes and an amplification of the mental faculties that surround vocabulary and dissemination skills, rather than an increase of manual dexterity. The Exalt must use this Charm against each interval she wishes to shorten, and must be able to dedicate the required time and writing instruments to the task. If this Charm is used in combination with its prerequisite, ignore this Charm’s Willpower cost. A repurchase at Essence 4+ allows the Exalt to pay twelve motes, one Willpower, to reduce an interval by two units. Reducing the work of years to months, or seasons to weeks is a challenging feat if the Solar does all the work mentally ; if she is physically writing, she may need Whirling Brush Method to keep up with the speed at which she can process ideas. The Lawgiver may not yet reduce production time of a tome to less than a unit of weeks. A second repurchase at Essence 5+ allows the Exalt to pay fifteen motes, one Willpower, to reduce an interval by a full three units of time. An Exalt with this Charm can reduce the time it takes to produce work from years to weeks, and from months to hours.

The Solar must be within fifty yards of the surface she is speaking words onto. Anyone who reads this message is subject to any social influence entailed in the script — usually modeled as a typical contest of Linguistics vs. Resolve — but only the first time they read it. As long as the Solar keeps motes committed to this effect, the script cannot be scrubbed from the surface of the wall, and any attempt to write over it fails. If the script it painted over, it bleeds through. Any attempt to otherwise cover it ends in horrific botches. The only way to remove the Lawgiver’s words are to kill her, destroy the surface her words are written on, or use a special sorcerous working (Terrestrial Circle, Ambition 2, Finesse 1, Terminus 3). This sorcerous working costs no experience points, but requires one point of temporary Willpower on each one week interval. Failing to reach the goal by the terminus makes this effect immune to any sorcerous tampering by any sorcerer for two weeks. This failure can be noticed by a character using All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight (Exalted p. 356) or similar magic. By paying one Willpower when activating this Charm, the Lawgiver raises the difficulty of removing her words with a sorcerous working to (Terrestrial Circle, Ambition 2, Finesse 3, Terminus 1) and can choose to gouge her words into a surface as hard as granite.

This Charm represents a Solar whose mind flows with a command of knowledge so potent it can reverse the decay of Creation. Channeling endless lore through unsurpassed Essence, the Solar stands at the edge of the world and forces shape into the howling teeth of the storm. System: Through use of this Charm, the Solar can fashion the raw forces of chaos into practically anything—so long as her mind is able to conceptualize the reality of her desire and force it to take shape. This Charm occurs in and depends on phases to accomplish such a feat. Wyld-Shaping Technique consists of a dramatic action lasting about a minute, in which the Solar forces her will upon the Wyld, pays the cost of the Charm, and makes an (Intelligence + Lore) roll against a specified difficulty. Each time she succeeds at this roll, a phase is completed. Some things can be shaped in a single phase. Others require that the Solar continue to use Wyld-Shaping Technique, phase after phase, in order to reach an appropriate phase on which to accomplish her goal. Each time she reaches a new phase and repays the cost of the Charm, her results from the previous phase are dissolved and reshaped. Essentially, the Solar must shape and reshape the Wyld in order to create larger, more powerful, or more specific results. The base difficulty of using Wyld-Shaping Technique is 5. At each new phase, the difficulty increases by one. Therefore , at phase three the difficulty would be 7, and phase six would require overcoming a difficulty of 10. During each phase, the Solar must remain near the relative epicenter of her shaping action. She can defend and attack, and she can move in response to her own environmental shaping, but she cannot engage in other extended actions such as sorcery. If she is incapacitated or fails the difficulty roll, the consequences are severe. She loses the cost of her Charm, including any invested experience points, and the shaping action fails completely. Moreover, she will experience a backlash if she botches, provoking an immune response from the Wyld—whatever she was trying to shape will turn against her and try to strike her down. The higher the phase at which this occurs, the more powerful the Wyld’s response will be. Considerations: In order to activate this Charm, the Solar must be standing at the absolute border of the middlemarches , facing the deep Wyld, or must otherwise be within the deep Wyld itself. Wyld-Shaping Technique requires the pure, inchoate resonance of chaos to work; the bordermarches and middlemarches of Creation are too solid to shape. Therefore, the more complex or large a thing the Solar wishes to shape, the deeper into the deep Wyld she needs to go. It would suffice for her to shape a gold ingot at Creation’s rim, but to raise an island of Creation from the Wyld, she would need to travel several miles into chaos. Use of Wyld-Shaping Technique automatically ends use of Chaos-Repelling Pattern in every direction around the Solar for three range bands. While the Exalt is employing this Charm, the Wyld is suborned by her supernal will. As with Chaos-Repelling Pattern, her immediate atmosphere will remain stable, and will adhere to the laws of physics for the Charm’s duration. Unlike Chaos-Repelling Pattern, the Lawgiver can be affected by body- and soul-shaping magic while working this Charm, unless she is under the aegis of Charms such as Integrity-Protecting Prana or Wyld-Dispelling Prana. As with Chaos-Repelling Pattern, the Solar can still be attacked by Wyld-spawned denizens while using Wyld-Shaping Technique. In fact, use of this Charm almost certainly guarantees that she will be. Encounter Roll: At the start of each phase, after the Charm’s cost has been paid but before the player has made the Charm’s roll, there is an encounter roll to determine whether the Solar is challenged by denizens of the Wyld. Roll a single die and add the Solar’s Essence to the result to determine the outcome. At each subsequent phase, remove 1 from the roll result. 8+: No encounter. 7: A small group (3-5) of weak enemies such as hobgoblins or pumpkin -men attacks. 6: A more powerful Fair Folk appears with a number of weaker minions. 5: A raksha hunting party (3-5 members) with a number of hunting beasts and minions appear. 4: As 5, but the force is slightly larger and led by a raksha noble. Alternately, a powerful Wyldspawned monster appears. 3: A number of powerful Fair Folk (hannya, noble raksha or otherwise) or other Wyld denizens emerge. Alternately, multiple Wyld-spawned monsters emerge. 2: The Solar is swarmed by hundreds of weaker Fair Folk or other Wyld denizens, joined by a number of powerful fae creatures; alternately, a dozen monsters are shaped by the Wyld to go on the attack. 1-0: A behemoth stirs from its slumber to attack the Solar. Phases: The Solar must reach a certain phase of Wyld- Shaping Technique in order to raise substance from chaos. For example, if a shaping project must be completed on phase two, the phase is successfully completed after the Exalt succeeds at the Charm’s roll. Land: The Solar can create non-specific land much more easily than she can raise very specific tracts. It is much easier for her to call forth massive amounts of general land than it is for her to induct very specific geography, and smaller, more specific geography is much more difficult than larger masses of land simply exuded from her formidable unconscious. For non-specific land, she can create (Essence x10) square miles of land in the first phase, and every successive phase multiplies this by three until phase eight. From phase eight and onward, each successive phase adds (Essence x1000) square miles. Additionally, the Solar can spend extra successes in each phase to add ten square miles to the land’s area at a rate of two successes per ten square miles. After phase seven, the cost decreases to one success per one hundred square miles. With non-specific land, the climate, geography, wildlife, spirits, and sentient beings that exist there will correlate with the nearest Pole. Until phase three, no demesnes are guaranteed to form, though previously generated land can still be geomantically sculpted to produce demesnes. After phase three, non-specific land will generate at least one additional minor demesne each phase, and any non-specific land created at phase six or beyond is guaranteed to have a number of major and minor demesnes. The Solar may spend three successes in any phase to roll a single die; success guarantee a demesne forms, with 7s and 8s equaling a minor demesne of appropriate aspect, 9s equaling a major demesne of appropriate aspect, and a 10 equaling a major demesne with an aspect specified by the Solar. The Solar may not add more demesnes to a created landmass than she has spent on upgrades to its area (ie, she must spend two extra successes on increasing land size in order to add an extra demesne). The larger a landmass the Solar is able to create, the more natural resources it will have. The more demesnes it has, the greater the chance it will contain veins of the five magical materials. The Lawgiver may not begin to create very specific land until phase four; she must first generate three phases of non-specific land in order to generate specific land, at which point she starts completely over, losing all generated land, creatures, and demesnes, generating [[ @{essence} * 5 ]](Essence x5) square miles in the first phase, and multiplying the preceding area by five in each successive phase until phase seven. In phase seven the area increases as above, at a rate of [[ @{essence} * 1000 ]](Essence x1000) square miles per phase. Increasing square miles in this calculation costs three successes per ten square miles, and the cost of demesne generation is four successes per demesne. With specific land, the Solar can designate the kind of terrain, resources or lack of them, the kind of climate and the kind of denizens. The Solar may specify the aspect of all minor demesnes created by rolls or those that naturally occur at later phases. At phase six, she can designate the kinds of sentient creatures living in her world, and such creatures will have both positive and negative Intimacies toward her. She has no control over the spirits inducted into her reality, but each that intrudes on her domain at this phase or beyond will automatically have an Intimacy centered on her of the Storyteller’s choosing. Legendary Demesne: Without Charms specifically dedicated to the creation of legendary demesnes, a Solar must succeed at a phase seven or higher roll for specific land to create a legendary demesne, and she must have at least five major, roll-generated demesnes to do so. If successful , she loses all of her roll-generated demesnes and all minor demesnes, and half her land’s area, to shape a legendary demesne. She may then start building land mass again at phase one, using the above rules. Mundane Wealth: Creating wealth is a process similar to creating land. Each resources value increase requires that the Solar reach a certain phase by synthesizing appropriate precursor materials. For example, a silver dirham (worth a bit over Resources 2) is required in order to make five silver talents (Resources 3). At phase one, the Solar can make wealth in excess of Resources 2. Examples of such wealth include a silver dirham, a single well-cut diamond, or half a dozen gold ingots. Extra successes can be used to personalize or specialize such material wealth, giving exquisite, exotic shape and cut to a single diamond or fashioning a number of ingots into jewelry at a rate of two successes per transformation. At phase two, Resources 3 mundane wealth can be created; at phase three, materials in excess of Resources 3 can be created; at phase four, Resources 4 wealth can be created, and at phase five, wealth in excess of Resources 4 but below Resources 5 can be created. A phase six transformation of materials is required to create Resources 5 wealth. Phases in excess of six do not greatly increase the wealth generated by Wyld-Shaping Technique. Five Magical Materials: In order to create an instance of one of the five magical materials, the Solar must create a minor demesne of the appropriate aspect using the rules above. She may then completely obliviate the land and attached demesnes in order to create enough ore to process it into a single mina in phase one. A phase two synthesis lets her turn the approximated magical material into a single bar of the same type of material; a phase three synthesis allows her to create as much as a talent, while a phase four synthesis allows her to create two talents, and so on. It takes approximately five talents of a magical material to build a grand daiklave. Artifacts and Manses: Artifacts, manses, and certain other wonders require special Charms in order to create with Wyld-Shaping Technique. Everything Else: Wyld-Shaping Technique works through a process of conceptual graduation. In order to raise a fortress, the Solar must first create land to stand it on. The Solar may create anything within the realm of possibility, her logic, or her know-how by following these basic rules. To create a mighty warship, she must raise a cradle to set it on in phase one, or otherwise must have created a body of water to float it in using specific land. The boat is then created in phase two. The deeper into the phases of specific land she goes, the more warships she is able to raise in a single phase, so long as she continues to grow the body of water with each successive phase. A Solar who spends the effort and experience points to create an ocean can also raise up an armada on its waters. The creation of land can be foregone in instances where the Solar can conceptualize some other base for beginning her project, such as the cradle for a ship, but the most powerful expressions of Wyld-Shaping Technique work by way of graduating from one concept to the next. It is much easier to create a number of warships by first creating the waters they sail upon. This process is reversed in order to build even more insane constructs. To raise up marvels such as golem manufactories , the Solar must catabolize something much more powerful, such as a legendary demesne.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"lore":5,"essence":3},"prereq":["Wyld-Shaping Technique"],"charm-skill":"Lore","charm-name":"Hero-Induction Method","charm-type":"Permanent","charm-duration":"Permanent","charm-cost":"—","rep-cost-mote":0,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Ex3 Core","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"The Solar can teach the land to hone its masters.","charm-effect":"With use of this Charm, each time the Exalt uses Wyld-Shaping Technique to build a place of trade, practice, or service, her creation will also produce a specialist to work there.

If she creates a blacksmith’s forge, one of the arisen mortals will be a blacksmith with an appropriately high Craft score. If she creates a hunting lodge, her working will produce hunters. If she creates a medicine hut, her land will produce a shaman-healer, and so on.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"lore":5,"essence":3},"prereq":["Wyld-Shaping Technique"],"charm-skill":"Lore","charm-name":"Wyld Cauldron Mastery","charm-type":"Permanent","charm-duration":"Permanent","charm-cost":"—","rep-cost-mote":0,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Ex3 Core","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"The Lawgiver’s greater understanding increases her power to more easily shape the Wyld.","charm-effect":"This Charm grants [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic successes to each phase of Wyld-Shaping Technique.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"lore":5,"essence":3},"prereq":["Wyld-Shaping Technique"],"charm-skill":"Lore","charm-name":"Wyld-Called Weapon","charm-type":"Reflexive","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"7m, 1wp, 8xp","rep-cost-mote":7,"rep-cost-will":1,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Ex3 Core","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"In order to shape a daiklave or other Artifact weapon from the Wyld, the Solar must be capable of a greater refinement of Wyld-Shaping Technique.","charm-effect":"This Charm models Solars who have mastered one such refinement.

Her player may then make a pronouncement against an ongoing project based on knowledge her studies reveal, creating bonuses for those who act in accordance with her accurate predictions, and penalties for those who go against them. For example, after reading about the patterns of weather, hostile elemental activity and famine in Jiara during the summer months over the last thousand years, she predicts that Mnemon will not attack Jiaran rebels until fall at the earliest, and will instead spend the summer months consolidating her forces while conserving water and gathering resources for a winter campaign. If Mnemon enacts a project to consolidate her forces while gathering resources until winter, the Storyteller should consider Mnemon ’s project vastly more successful and easier to complete than otherwise. If Mnemon instead decides to invade Jiaran rebel territory in the summer, her invasion will be met with project difficulties, such as resource shortages, elemental attacks, inclement weather, and more specifically, mechanical penalties to the first War rolls her generals make in the conflict. Conversely, if Mnemon harbors her forces and the Jiaran rebels instead try to attack her, it is their commanders who will suffer penalties to their opening War rolls.

On Hundred Sages Focus I came up with this Charm while preparing to run my own personal game of Exalted. As I was seeding the environment with deeply-seated lore and “unsolvable” mysteries, I started looking at the hidden histories of my game and deciding what it would take for our group’s Lore Solar to crack those mysteries wide open. In my game notes I started tagging environmental features thusly: “geological formation: geology difficulty 3”, “colossal arm of blue stone sticking out of the mountain: ‘biography of the Celestial Incarnae’ difficulty 10” and so on. In the former case, geology is the needed background or “Lore topic.” The latter refers to a book in a library in Yu-Shan, of which there is no other copy, and which has never been to Creation. Whenever I contemplate running an Exalted game, I always consider which Charms my players are using and which Abilities they are going to be rolling, and then I fill out the structure of every night’s gaming with a list of interesting Ability checks and opportunities to use said Charms. I seed the environment with difficult challenges . For my friend the investigator, I create mysteries and leave evidence. For the Solar savant, I fill the game with wondrous lore. For the occult specialist, strange and uncanny mysteries that are outside Lore’s purview. In essence, I build my personal games of Exalted around my players. This Charm is an outgrowth of that, allowing a player to mine the hidden secrets from the setting, to find the presents I have buried for the whole Circle to stare at — in wonder, in horror. One last thing: Harmonious Academic Methodology increases the gamut of your Solar’s knowledge. So if you find your Storyteller has placed a mystery in front of you that is outside your Solar’s background, hit the library, conduct interviews at the local academy, quiz a Sidereal, put a spirit in a headlock and make them teach you — whatever it takes to expand your Solar’s mind — and use that Charm whenever you can, so your Solar’s knowledge grows voluminously.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"lore":5,"essence":3},"prereq":["Wake the Sleeper"],"charm-skill":"Lore","charm-name":"Legend-Spirit Convocation","charm-type":"Permanent","charm-duration":"Permanent","charm-cost":"–","rep-cost-mote":0,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Solar : MotSE","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"This Charm upgrades the prerequisite, allowing it to be used on weapons and armor forged of natural metals such as brass, iron, and steel.

The empowering effect of Wake the Sleeper is less profound on such mortal panoplies: the roll is always difficulty 2, and the weapon gains a single Instant-duration Evocation whether it is successful or not.

This Charm explicitly allows the Solar to use Heavenly Guardian Defense in crash, up to a limit of her gathered (or double gathered) bonus Initiative. This bonus Initiative may not be used to amplify the instance of Heavenly Guardian Defense from which it was gathered, nor can it be targeted by withering attacks; the Initiative is gone until the moment in which the Solar chooses to summon it.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"melee":1,"essence":1},"prereq":[],"charm-skill":"Melee","charm-name":"Nimble Reaving Wind","charm-type":"Reflexive","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"1m","rep-cost-mote":1,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Solar : MotSE","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Dual","charm-description":"The Solar moves across the battlefield like an implacable force.","charm-effect":"She may use this Charm on her turn to move away from a target without using a disengage action, so long as she uses her movement to enter into close range with another target and uses her attack action against that target.

Arc Shedding Rain Technique can only be used once per round, but may be reset during the round by successfully parrying any attack while suffering an onslaught penalty of -2 or greater, or by parrying the attack of a dangerous opponent, or by killing any opponent with a Counterattack Charm. On Arc Shedding Rain Technique The backer’s favorite anime is Moribito, so she wanted a Melee Charm that would help her fight like Balsa. This was a tricky Charm to write, as Melee Charms have to work not only with spears, but with axes, swords, claymores, etc. After watching Balsa fight, I decided to make the Charm a very solid defense against greater numbers that would allow the Solar to create openings for Charms such as Savage Wolf Attack (Exalted p. 419), or yet-unwritten Martial Arts or Brawl Charms.

The insight the Solar gains is fleeting and momentary; this advantage fades after the Solar has used this Charm, and she must witness or experience her opponent’s defense again in one round in order to use this Charm in the round that follows. On Stark Truth of Steel Method The backer wanted a Melee Charm that would allow him to exploit a flaw in his opponent’s defense to land an attack. I felt that a Charm that magnified wound or onslaught penalties was a bit too divorced from an expression of Melee skill, so I went with this Charm, which would reveal a weakness or flaw in an opponent through a mystical insight.

A repurchase of this Charm allows an Exalt using Ready in Eight Directions Stance to keep their Initiative from returning to base at the end of the round, so long as they successfully parry every attack launched at them during the round while using Victorious Wreath. On Victorious Wreath (Against the World Stance) The backer wanted a Melee Charm for use by his Solar, the Invincible Sword Princess. He wanted Princess to have a Charm that would help her deal with focus fire from a group of opponents, so I came up with an effect that would defray the cost of continual use of Dipping Swallow Defense or Ready in Eight Directions Stance. I imagine fighting the Invincible Sword Princess to be like trying to fight someone who is wreathed in Essence and steel and able to move faster than light.

Done in a temple, pillars will begin to slide off of their bases. Done in a forest, trees will begin to topple all around the Solar.

On Omniscient Focus Attack I wrote this bonus Charm to give Solar Melee a little more overt supernatural capacity. The Solar can clash an opponent with the hypothetical ability to strike while immaterial. The ability to attack while immaterial is typically a power belonging only to spirits. Omniscient Focus Attack will work on concealed foes as well. For the most part, attacking from concealment reveals the attacker’s location, but if they are using magic to keep this from happening and yet the Solar does a lot of damage or kills them with her clash, the Storyteller should consider them revealed anyway, as the Solar slashes through a grate and blood pours from the place of concealment , or a dead body tumbles down out of a well of perfect shadows.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"melee":5,"essence":3},"prereq":["Fervent Blow","Hail-Shattering Practice"],"charm-skill":"Melee","charm-name":"All-Sundering Strike","charm-type":"Supplemental","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"3m, 1wp","rep-cost-mote":3,"rep-cost-will":1,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Solar : MotSE","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Clash","charm-description":"The Solar meets an attack with a strike that can cut through the heavens.","charm-effect":"This Charm supplements a clash attack, allowing the Solar to roll her clash twice and take the higher of two results.

This act has great mystical significance, recorded in the celestial registers of Heaven, as the Lawgiver swears on her weapon and her skill to protect what is most dear. Thenceforth, whenever the Exalt makes a Melee attack in defense of the attached Intimacy and pays one mote, she gains bonus dice equal to (Intensity). In addition, if her target has acted to harm one of her Ties or threaten one of her Principles, a successful attack adds damage equal to the target’s strongest opposed Intimacy to the Solar or her protected Tie or Principle. In simple terms, the Lawgiver may not know her opponent’s Intimacies, but the Storyteller does, and can select the most appropriate Intimacy on the damage roll. If the Solar has vowed to protect the street urchins of Nighthammer, she may not realize that her target despises children, but the damage of her attack rips through his corrosive spirit and wounds him that much more deeply. This Charm confers no knowledge of Intimacies to the Solar. In addition, if the target is a cursed, blighted creature, such as a ghost or a demon, or one of the Abyssal Exalted, the damage on this attack is increased by one, gains one automatic success, and the damage is aggravated. On Divine Executioner Stance The backer wanted a Melee Charm that would give him some added whomp from drawing on his Intimacies for an attack. A critical read on this Charm reveals that Solar Essence rips through and obliterates beings that are antithetical to the Solar’s spirit, ideals, and personal character. Intimacies are important to the formulation of a character’s identity, and a character’s identity is the foundation of their Essence, their total being.

On Divine Instrument I deliberated for a long time about whether to include this in the effect in the core book. I even wrote it as a different Charm, but decided to cut it for space. This Charm is actually a much better version with a more interesting name and mechanic. For those who are interested, the Abyssal version is very similar, and has you drawing a musician’s bow across the Shroud, eliciting a screech as it passes over invisible strings into your hand. Then as you flourish and bow in introduction, your instrument appears in a gout of black flame. But don’t worry; if you don’t use a bow, plectrum, baton, et al, you’ll still be covered.

A raging inferno that covers a hundred miles will snuff out in a path large enough for her party to pass safely through, a river of magma becomes cool enough to cross barefoot, and a hurricane may be diverted narrowly from its course. The Solar’s music need only contend with elemental forces for a handful of seconds in order to dispel them, but this effect lasts [[ @{essence} * 30 ]](Essence x 30) minutes, despite the listed duration. Lastly, the effect is centered around the Solar, and if she is still in a state of danger from the environmental hazard when this Charm’s time is up, she becomes aware of her need to re-use the Charm at least five minutes in advance. In that case, waive the Willpower cost to reactivate the Charm. A repurchase of this Charm allows the Exalt to deal with supernatural environmental hazards and unusual hazards such as acid baths. She can turn a cauldron of boiling oil into a warm bath or ward off the demon winds of Malfeas. After a repurchase, at Essence 4+, the Solar can use this Charm to destroy a sorcerous working that is barring her in the pursuit of a Defining Intimacy, rolling Charisma or Manipulation + Performance against the Resolve of the sorcerer who placed it, even if they are dead. A success allows her to shatter a minor working, or undo a major working until she has safely passed through it. Such a working is typically never an environmental hazard. It might be a massive seam where two mountains were fused to seal a path, an immovable capstone over a cave of lost dreams, a mind-worm whose screams force your best friend to fight you to the death, and so on. On Seventeen Cycles Symphony The backer wanted a Charm that would allow him to play a Solar Orpheus, able to quell nature’s wrath. I liked the idea so much I decided to expand it to make it a real homage to the mythical hero, who would stop at nothing in his quest. Storytellers should allow some creative latitude in basic interpretation of this Charm. A bank of thick fog over a rocky bay might not count as an environmental hazard in the strictest terms, but you should let a Solar dispel the fog so her captain can steer a safer course. Her song can’t get rid of the rocks, but perhaps it can calm the tides. You also might note that using this to cut a swath through a blizzard won’t make it magically warm and sunny. It will just get rid of the worst, most dangerous and threatening conditions of the blizzard, allowing your group to pass.

The subject also gains three specific spirit Charms — two minor miracles, and one major miracle — that fit their most significant Principles. Any time they use the cult-derived point of Willpower to enhance one of their dice rolls to uphold or defend one of their Intimacies, the prayers of the cult are channeled into them for a moment, giving them the Essence they need to perform the Charm for the Charm’s duration. This does not grant the mortal an Essence pool, but allows them to sustain divine, transformative power in accordance with the divinity conferred to them by the Solar and the mystic power generated by her worshipers . The subject loses access to these miracles if the Solar ends her commitment to this Charm. As long as the Solar is continually expanding her cult through overt and subtle miracles, the Willpower her subject draws from the Solar’s cult does not diminish the reservoir of worship (Willpower) the Solar herself draws upon.

For one who wishes to spy on the Solar’s enemies, thereby upholding a Principle of belief in the Solar’s right to rule, the subject’s major miracle could be something like “Creeping Willow Meditation” in which her flesh becomes as bark and gnarled wood and she winds herself around a tree, melding with it so that she goes completely unnoticed in the forest where conspirators are known to meet.

Against any attack which might knock her from her mount, she gains +1 Defense. Horse-Summoning Whistle: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to call a loyal mount to her side. The mount makes its way to her as circumstances best allow. Master Horseman’s Eye: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively when evaluating a mount to perfectly recognize its strengths and weaknesses. Speed-Sustaining Technique: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively and touch a mount to sustain it for two hours. Effort during that time does not exhaust the creature, and it does not suffer harmful random incidents such as thrown shoes and injured hooves. Spirit-Steadying Assurances: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively to stop a mount from panicking. For one instant, the mount shakes off all natural or supernatural fear, and may not be intimidated by direct effort for [[@{essence}]](Essence) rounds, or indirect circumstances for the scene’s duration. Blood Rider’s Toughness: The Solar and her mount are as a single being with one skin. The Solar will never chafe or develop sores from long rides, and both the Lawgiver and her mount may ride for twice as long without food, water, or rest.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"ride":2,"essence":1},"prereq":["Master Horseman’s Techniques"],"charm-skill":"Ride","charm-name":"Flashing Thunderbolt Steed","charm-type":"Reflexive","charm-duration":"One hour","charm-cost":"4m","rep-cost-mote":4,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Ex3 Core","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"By tapping her own spirit, the Solar can imbue her mount with endless energy.","charm-effect":"The mount can run at full speed for an hour without becoming fatigued, and gains an automatic success toward all movement and balance-related actions.

The moment she uses this Charm, she knows her exact latitude, longitude, and bearing, and can plot an accurate course without a roll. On Perfect Reckoning Technique Originally this Charm was in the core rules, but I changed that Charm’s name to Safe Bearing Technique in order to have a more powerful version of this classic Solar Charm. Because Creation is flat, getting latitude and longitude works differently. It requires charts that map the course of the sun at certain dates and times of the day, and the use of a backstaff to measure the sun’s angle and distance from the horizon. This is a difficulty 3 roll for those who have been trained (Celestial Navigation specialty in Sail), difficulty 4 for those who have not. Without charts and a backstaff, the difficulty is raised by 2. A Solar with this Charm always knows her position relevant to the sun’s arc even at night, and she can see through sunlight to the North Star even by day. The reason this Charm requires her to be on a ship atop a body of water is because she is “feeling” along the greater surface area of her submerged hull to sense the flow of Water Essence. All bodies of water in Creation, even the Dreaming Sea, are resonant with the Pole of Earth — if one can feel along the Essence that flows through oceans and rivers, one’s sense will inevitably be pulled toward the Pole of Earth. Thus a Solar standing on a ship, floating on water, needs no jade magnet needle to know the direction of the Imperial Mountain in relation to the North.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"sail":5,"essence":3},"prereq":[],"charm-skill":"Sail","charm-name":"Mast of Everything Situation","charm-type":"Simple","charm-duration":"One scene","charm-cost":"10m, 1wp","rep-cost-mote":10,"rep-cost-will":1,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Solar : MotSE","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Apocryphal","charm-description":"Sometimes your ship’s mast suddenly explodes.

Roll the Solar’s Wits + Sail against that of her adversary. If the Solar has the greater result, her maneuvering not only allows her ship to skate through unscathed, but also causes the other ship to wreck spectacularly. This might involve the Solar sailing to the edge of a waterfall and pulling an impossible u-turn as her adversary sails right over the edge, or it might describe a Solar pushing her skyship into a steep descent, so the sun blinds her pursuer and causes them to wreck on a high cliff. However, if the Solar loses the clash of sail, her opponent not only escapes the trap, but it also backfires, doing two damage to the hull of the Solar’s ship. This Charm can be used once per story, but may be reset by using Sail to overcome a distinct disadvantage that threatens your crew or your ship. This Charm can in fact reset itself. Repeatedly, if needs be. On Death-Daring Manuever This Charm is chiefly apocryphal because it is really powerful.

To use this Charm, the Exalt activates it and becomes keenly aware of every flaw in her opponents’ movements. The Solar’s player begins to track all 1s and 2s rolled by enemy captains in the scene. When 15 of these have been accrued, they can be “spent” as special momentum to trigger this Charm’s unique stratagem, in which the ship teleports out of the way of a broadside maneuver (Exalted, p. 245) or other successful attack, phasing her ship out and in at a new position at the same relative distance from the enemy vessel. This counts as an uncontested positioning stratagem (Exalted, p. 245) — roll the Solar’s Wits + Sail and convert the result to momentum. In addition, this momentum can be paid to roll an immediate Broadside attack against the attacking enemy. Master and Commander Method can be used in one scene per story, and within that scene as many times as the Solar can charge it. An Essence 4+ repurchase also allows the Solar to count her enemy’s 3s in order to use it. It can be reset by overcoming a major enemy while sailing under some penalty that cannot be easily rectified through the use of the Solar’s current Sail Charms. On Master and Commander Method The backer wanted a Charm that was as close as possible to the Picard Maneuver from Star Trek, which involves flying your starship at an attacking starship using warp speed to confuse ship sensors and create an illusion of being in two places at once, allowing the phasing ship to launch an unexpected salvo against the confused vessel . The main reason this is apocryphal is because Solar Charms tend to depict one single action and this depicts several. The Solar teleporting her ship and crew over a short distance is a legal effect if it is reasonably hard to do, but this Charm requires the completion of multiple actions that stretches the limits of how Solar magic functions , and it might make the Charm feel like more of an actor than the Solar. As stated in the core rules on page 250, Charms don’t “do” anything. Charms reflect the actions of the Solar. A Solar’s action can entail wholly supernatural expansions of the Ability, but their skill must always be present. Like all other characters in Exalted, Solars are limited to specific actions per round. When a Charm depicts multiple complicated actions being completed that are usually left as round to round interactions of the rules and Storytelling, it starts to mark out the Charm as more of an actor than the Solar. Just remember this is a very apocryphal Charm and you should be wary of treating Solar mechanics this way.

Some of you might think this Charm doesn’t work by its example, because someone with a positive view of the Guild would have to have a positive view of slavery. But that’s not actually true — the Guild deals in a number of vast enterprises, and this can work to conceal the effects of slave labor.

This Charm ignores restrictions on Intimacy use in decision points — the Exalt may use this Charm even if the target has already cited the shared Intimacy in a decision point. Nor does it count as exploiting a Tie to the Solar directly. With a stunt, the Solar can also use a shared experience (such as serving in the same mercenary company during a legendary battle) as a reason for persuasion, even if there is no actual clear Intimacy being shared.

I could tell from his description that he wanted something a little more versatile than Hidden Snake Recoil. The problem with this effect has always been balancing it. Fighting from a state of concealment is prohibitive on purpose. Thus, I balanced this Charm against the significant advantage it confers. Charms that follow Shadow-Striking Way will only enhance it in very gradual ways.

Normally, training an animal to unlock its latent potential requires a minimum of Survival 3, and two specialties : one in animal husbandry, and another specific to the animal—falconry for a hawk, lion taming for a great cat, and so on. The trainer makes an extended roll with an interval of one month and a goal of 10, modified by the animal’s attitude—docile and tamed beasts presenting no penalties, familiars representing a number of bonus dice equal to the trainer’s Intimacy to the animal, and hostile, wild, or otherwise untrainable animals representing a penalty of -2 or -3. The trainer must spend the entire month interacting with the beast, teaching it words, signals, commands, and running it through exercises daily. Any significant amount of time the trainer spends away from the beast during this time saps successes away at a rate of one success for every two or three days.

These animals assemble into a Size 2 battle group (see Exalted p. 205) with average Drill — elite if they are pack hunters such as wolves or Lions — and Might 0 unless they are diminutive creatures such as rabbits or squirrels, in which case the amplitude of Solar Essence increases their Might to 2. Outside of combat, this battle group takes around ten minutes to assemble unless the assembled beasts are particularly slow. Battle groups of incredibly fast creatures such as hawks can assemble in less than a minute, as can battle groups composed as creatures who are in the immediate vicinity. In combat, assembly takes a number of rounds equal to eight minus the Dexterity of the average member of the battle group, or a single round if the subjects are all nearby or are incredibly swift. The battle group is led by the Solar’s familiar. If the familiar is not present, the battle group will still instinctively attack targets on the Solar’s behalf, and will attempt to follow her if she moves or attempts to flee or indicates a new target for them to savage. War Charms that directly control battle groups are ineffective at leading such a mob, but Survival Charms that enhance the familiar’s own actions allow it to pass on orders and bonuses from the Solar’s War Charms, such as it is able to understand them. Lastly, at Essence 4+, all successful withering attacks made by this battle group award half the Initiative (rounded up) to the Solar’s familiar, if it is present on the battlefield. This Charm has no effect on the familiars of other characters , spirit animals, or an animal that has a Major or Defining Intimacy of hatred for the Solar. On Riotous Cry of the Beast The backer wanted to use his Survival to call up an army of forest creatures to aid him in battle. I expanded the concept to any creature matching the Exalt’s familiar, and conceptualized it as a battle group and tertiary buff for your familiar. This Charm also allows rather “weak” animals to remain valid choices for a familiar. Players are encouraged to conceptualize a Might 2 animal as moving at tremendous speeds, leaping through the air, and fighting with unusual bravery, just like a Solar.

Large creatures grow exponentially; a bull grows larger than a war elephant, while already gigantic creatures grow slightly less, a war elephant growing large enough to peer into a second story window. Smaller familiars become large enough to ride, reaching excesses of 1000 pounds. In addition to the benefits of the prerequisite and Saga Beast Virtue, familiars gain an additional three mutations. The largest familiars (tyrant lizards, mammoths, giant snakes) gain three automatic non-Charm successes to their feats of strength, and may reach into the short range band to attack targets. In addition, targets at short range must roll disengage to move away from such a massive opponent. As targets at close range must also disengage to escape, a target who starts at close range must disengage twice to get away.

The smaller familiars compensate by gaining three automatic non-Charm successes to rush and disengage, and one automatic success to each of their attacks. They gain two -0 health levels.

Lastly, this Charm allows the Solar to use the prerequisite reflexively in combination with itself.

This Charm does not confer knowledge of whether or not this is happening, so if it is not clearly apparent, the player should consider using Awareness Charms and the prerequisite, Angle-Tracing Edge. With Awareness Charms dedicated to hearing, the Solar could commit herself to listening for the nigh-inaudible pull of a bowstring, and with the appropriate Awareness roll (difficulty or Stealth contest determined by the Storyteller) she could pinpoint the exact position of an archer hiding out of sight, and bounce her missile off a wall or a parapet (via prerequisite) to strike her target and stop them from taking aim. Note that this Charm does not specify who the target is aiming at. Use this Charm to judiciously intercept the slings and arrows that will no doubt be hurled at your Solar’s friends and allies.

If successful, roll (Strength + Thrown) to establish clinch control, with a number of automatic successes equal to extra successes on the initial attack roll plus one. The control roll cannot be modified by Thrown or other Ability Charms. If successful the target is snared for the number of control rounds plus one. If the number of control rounds exceeds their Strength, they also fall to the ground. A snared character can attempt to struggle free by spending a complete action without a flurry to remove two rounds of control each turn. They can also instantly break free from snares made of non-magical materials (cords, cables, etc) with a Strength 5+ difficulty 5 feat of strength. Lastly, if the Lawgiver has the other end of a line, rope, or other tether hooked to the snare, then if she knows the Brawl Charm Crashing Wave Throw (Exalted p. 275) then she can use it to sling her opponent violently into scenery with a decisive throw. The Solar is considered to have [[ @{essence} + 1 ]](Essence + 1) more Strength than her actual rating for the purpose of this stunt. Damage on this attack resets the Solar to base Initiative. Lastly, unassisted characters must struggle at least one round to remove this snare, even if the control rounds have been completely expended. A net won’t just fall off on its own, and a character bound by the legs and hurled with Crashing Wave Throw isn’t set free by smashing into scenery, even though this forfeits all rounds of control. This gambit can be supplemented by Diving Hawk Discipline. On Whirlwind Hand of the Striker I know it is a complex Charm. Just make sure to record extra successes on the attack roll to apply to the control roll. The Crashing Wave Throw tie-in can be ignored if you don’t have Brawl, but if you want to play a character who hooks people by the legs with a weighted line and then hurls them to a dangle over the rooftops, this is the Charm for you. As an aside, if you want to free a snared character, there are a couple of ways you might do it. A Storyteller should require a character to use their action without a flurry and an appropriate stunt to try to help a friend get free, removing an additional -2 rounds of control. Alternately you might have them try a difficulty 3 gambit to cut the snare loose with an edged, lethal weapon.

When the Exalt’s battle group makes a successful attack against another battle group augmented by an order action, the Solar may use this Charm to take further control of the battle, forfeiting damage and using extra successes on the attack roll to place the enemy under the effects of a new stratagem. In literal terms, the Solar uses her superior knowledge and tactics to control the enemy army, forcing it into a disadvantageous state for the rest of the battle. The Exalt may instead use this Charm to erase a stratagem of equal or lesser value that has been used against her own forces, allowing them to escape from the most harrowing of disadvantages through her military genius. The Solar may deploy up to [[@{essence}]](Essence) additional stratagems with repeated use of this Charm.

This Charm is occluded, hidden from the normal roll of Solar Abilities, and only becomes available to the Solar to learn if she has a Defining Tie for her Lunar and vice versa, and if their bond has been deeply established according to the Storyteller. Then, in circumstances where they are touching each other — sparring, one holding the other’s wrist to keep them from going over a cliff, sharing a kiss, etc — the Storyteller may deem that the Solar feels a sudden oneness with her Lunar. The Lunar will feel this same oneness in turn. Roll their combined Essence scores, and if the result is one or greater, the Storyteller describes a numinous moment in which the Solar and Lunar touch mind and soul and become as one. This can be a completely disassociated stream of consciousness event, or it can be a series of images from their past lives. The end of this sequence leaves the Solar capable of learning this Charm. This Charm allows the Solar to physically merge with her Lunar mate, becoming a single entity of divine wrath and living flame for one scene. The combined being resembles a fusion of the Solar’s physical form with her iconic anima, and the spirit-animal of her Lunar mate. This form usually has four arms, has bestial and ethereal traits, such as horns, hair that floats and crackles with lightning, gale force-winds that whip around in her vicinity , and so on. The mote pool for the merged being is the Solar’s current pool + 25, and the health levels of the combined being are equal to the Lunar’s undamaged health levels. As a quick character, the fusion has all of the traits of the Solar, but the players may do the work to assign the merged character its own sheet, giving it the Lunar’s Attributes and the Solar’s Abilities. In any case, the merged Exalt uses all of the Solar’s Charms for actions, but its Attributes on any roll can be enhanced by any Attribute-boosting Charms the Lunar has learned. In addition, the form gains horns, fangs, claws, wings, and other mutations applicable to the Lunar’s spirit form and the Solar’s iconic manifestation, a number equal to the Lunar’s Appearance or Stamina +1. These natural weapons can be used to use animal attacks such as Bite, Gore, and so on, listed in the antagonists chapter of Exalted. To use this Charm, the Exalts must share a Defining Principle that they are merging in order to defend. If they are killed while in this form, they both die. Once they have used this Charm, they may not end their merged form until the end of the scene, though they may choose to end it if they fall into Initiative Crash. On Hallowed Bond of Night and Flame This Charm was written in response to a backer’s desire to see a Charm that uses the Solar / Lunar bond to make a merged being with some combination of Solar and Lunar Charms and appearance. This Charm is hugely apocryphal. If we were to allow something like this to happen normally, we’d require a deeper buildup with a number of requisite Charms and story events. However, it is a delightful Charm and if you really want to use it we hope the Apocryphal keyword won’t get in your way. According to the backer, this Charm was used by her Lunar, Scarlet-Wings-Over-The-Mountain and her Solar lover, Brass Storm Spirit. Storytellers beware, this Charm is mechanically overpowered.

Examples include making a dramatic speech to her followers, promulgating a set of rules, or employing Eloquent Example Inspiration. All organization members who witness this or hear of it from others intuitively realize the Abyssal’s Intimacy. This has the following effects: • All organization members who are aware of the Abyssal’s Intimacy gain its benefits as if they had it themselves, but it can’t be leveraged against them with social influence. A character who violates the Intimacy loses this benefit. • The Abyssal adds (Essence) dice on influence rolls against group members that align with the Intimacy. • The Abyssal adds (Essence) on Awareness, Investigation, and Socialize rolls against group members to uncover violations of the Intimacy.

Instead, the Storyteller chooses a Defining Intimacy that reflects the primal emotions and deep-seated fears of the Abyssal’s dreams, which guides the nightmare’s actions. For instance, it might have a Defining Tie of hatred toward an enemy who grievously wounded the deathknight, or a Defining Principle of mindless rage that echoes the Abyssal’s own wrath.

The Abyssal can use this Charm to shape the Underworld to her will. She can only use it within the Underworld proper, not including shadowlands. She can shape an area that extends out to (Essence x5) miles from her. She can’t shape inhabited regions if their denizens don’t want her to. This shaping is an extended (Intelligence + Lore) action with a, requiring a separate use of this Charm for each interval.The goal number depends on the effect the Abyssal wishes to invoke. Once she reaches the goal number, she can continue the shaping with a new effect, resetting her successes to zero. The roll has a base difficulty of 5, subject to the following modifiers. For example, an Abyssal who uses this Charm in the Labyrinth would roll first at difficulty 3, then difficulty 4, difficulty 5, and so on. Each successful roll lets the Abyssal make one of the following alterations. Some require her to first lay groundwork with other alterations — most notably, erasing existing terrain features to make way for new lands. Erase Terrain (Goal Number 5): The Abyssal eliminates a major feature of the landscape — a river, a mountain, a fortress. It fades away gradually, leaving barren wasteland in its place. Using this in ritual and primal afterlives can’t override their fundamental nature; whatever remains will still be thematically appropriate to them. Manses and other supernatural features can’t be erased, but don’t prevent the Abyssal from shaping around them. Alter Terrain (Goal Number 10): Once the Abyssal has erased all terrain features, she can remake the land. She creates a new terrain feature, raising up a hill out of the earth, opening a lake, or growing a forest of living bone. She can also add natural resources to the land, like veins of precious metal or deposits of the ore used to forge soulsteel. Particularly drastic changes may require multiple uses of this effect — creating a mountain to rival the Underworld’s tallest would require one use to create a hill, another to expand it into a mountain, and further uses to make it even larger. When shaping a primal or ritual afterlife, anything she creates will manifest in a way that fits their themes, regardless of what she intends. Demesnes (Goal Number 20 or 30): After creating a terrain feature, the deathknight may transform it into an Abyssal demesne. This has a goal number of 20 for two-dot demesnes and 30 for four-dot demesnes.. Objects and Structures (Goal Number 3, 10, or 20): After creating natural resources, the Abyssal can shape them into mundane objects or structures suited to the landscape she’s created. She could raise a funereal citadel from a mountain’s stone or shape veins of precious metal into jewelry for a reshaped necropolis’ ghostly populace. The goal number depends on the type of project that would be necessary to create the object: 3 for basic, 10 for major, and 20 for superior. Such creations often appear eerie, uncanny, or disturbing. Soulsteel (Goal Number 30): After creating the necessary ore, the Abyssal can shape it into soulsteel by binding ghosts within it. These unfortunate shades must either be willing or helpless. Creating enough soulsteel for an artifact weapon or armor requires at least five ghosts, or a single powerful shade. Creating enough soulsteel for multiple such artifacts or larger artifacts like warstriders require an additional use of this Charm to expand the shaped soulsteel — potentially more than one, depending on the scope of the Abyssal’s ambitions. Each use requires more and more ghosts, up to as many as a hundred per interval. Monstrosities: The Abyssal populates the shaped region with a nightmarish horror, with traits like those created by Night-Horror Summons. The Abyssal can continue shaping for as long as she can pay this Charm’s cost. She can act freely while shaping, including in combat, but can’t take other extended actions. This Charm ends prematurely if the Abyssal fails a roll for it or is incapacitated. Shaping the Underworld risks stirring dark forces. If she rolls six 1s in a single interval, the Storyteller may declare that a formidable threat is drawn to her or that she faces a peril like an earthquake or sudden storm as the shaped terrain rebels against her. Each interval, the number of 1s needed to trigger this is reduced by one, minimum (Abyssal’s Essence). If the Abyssal rolls more 1s than necessary, she may face even greater perils, like an undead behemoth rising from the Labyrinth.

The Abyssal desecrates a wilderness region, claiming it for the dead. It must be a single contiguous locale, like a forest, a bayou, or a mountain, but there’s no hard limit on how large a domain she can claim, save for the Storyteller’s discretion. She must spend at least a day traveling the entirety of the region, sowing teeth, bone-shards, and blighted seeds in the land. If the chosen region is inhabited, any mortal or ghostly communities in the area must be made to either accept her presence or recognize that they cannot drive her away. If any supernatural beings occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Abyssal must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. However, ghosts only count for this if their Essence equals or exceeds the Abyssal’s. Claiming a domain imposes the following effects: • The undead add (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) automatic successes on Survival rolls and rolls to resist the domain’s mundane environmental hazards. They count as having a Minor Tie of obedience to the Abyssal. • The living can’t regain Willpower from sleep within the domain. They subtract (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) successes from Survival rolls and rolls to resist mundane environmental hazards as the land rejects them. They count as having a Minor Tie of fear to the Abyssal. Wild animals don’t suffer these effects and count as having a Minor Tie of obedience to the Abyssal • Sunlight has no deleterious effects on the undead or things of the Underworld. It is always considered night for purposes of shadowlands and similar phenomena associated with death. • Wild animals that die within the domain are reanimated as undead horrors (p. XX). • Over the course of the story, a shadowland forms in the domain’s heart — the part of it that’s furthest from any towns, habitations, or similar developed areas. It spreads up to (Essence x10) miles outward from the heart, assuming no developed areas impede its spread. The shadowland opens into the nearest equivalent locale within the Underworld, often a primal afterlife related to death by wild animals, poisonous plants, or the like. The Abyssal can use Dark Roads of the Dead to travel to this shadowland without needing a roll. • If she uses Bleak Marches Wisdom for her domain, she doubles 7s on the roll and completes it instantly, without needing to scout in advance. An Abyssal can only have one such domain at a time. If she dies, it endures beyond her death, though it may then be possible to break it with curse-breaking magic or a sorcerous working at the Storyteller’s discretion. Special activation rules: When the Abyssal uses Nightmare-Carving Murmur (p. XX) to reshape land into a wilderness, she can use this Charm reflexively to claim that territory as her domain.","charm-rollexpr":""}],"Thrown":[{"attr-mins":{"thrown":1,"essence":1},"prereq":[],"charm-skill":"Thrown","charm-name":"Fatal Precision Technique","charm-type":"Supplemental","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"1m","rep-cost-mote":1,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Abyssal","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Withering-only","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Abyssal deals out death with unerring accuracy.

The Abyssal adds a free full Excellency when she Joins Battle against at least one nontrivial enemy whom she has interacted with socially within the last day. Before any character takes a turn, she may make a decisive attack against each enemy who satisfies one of the following conditions: • She’s succeeded on an inspire, instill, persuade, or read intentions roll against him in the current scene, or previously during an ongoing social event. • He’s failed on a roll against her Resolve or Guile in the current scene, or previously during an ongoing social event. • He has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward the Abyssal. • He’s a trivial enemy. The Abyssal doesn’t need to aim to attack enemies at medium range or beyond. Against enemies with Initiative lower than the Abyssal’s and trivial enemies, these attacks are ambushes (Exalted, p. 203). Otherwise, they’re surprise attacks. The deathknight divides her Initiative evenly, rounded up, among all hit opponents to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness. Trivial opponents suffer her full Initiative in damage, and aren’t included in the division. Once the attacks are completed, as long as any of them hit a nontrivial opponent, the Abyssal’s Initiative resets. Enemies who witness the attacks must roll (Wits + Awareness) at a difficulty of (Abyssal’s Essence + base Guile), similar to Knives Between Friends (p. XX).. Ambushed enemies automatically fail without receiving a roll. This is capable of triggerering Pitiless Scything Razor, but only against an enemy the Abyssal already ambushed in the initial barrage. If the Abyssal has any attacks banked with Courtier’s Murderous Contemplation, she can unleash them as part of this onslaught, ignoring that Charm’s once-per-round limit and applying the above benefits to each attack she makes.

If the deal is verbal, the hidden words slip past the target’s attention; if it’s written, his eye slips over the obfuscated terms. Because the target isn’t consciously aware of this part of the bargain, he cannot call on Intimacies that oppose it to bolster his Resolve or spend Willpower in Decision Points. Similarly, his Resolve isn’t penalized by Intimacies that support it. The Dragon-Blood’s influence roll subtracts a number of successes based on the severity of the clause. If it’s comparable to an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216), such as a hidden fee, it suffers −1 success. If it’s a serious  task, such as committing a serious crime or making payments that risk bankrupting the target, it suffers −3 successes. If it’s a life-changing task, such as convincing  someone to sell himself into slavery or trading a queen a horse for her palace, it suffers −5 successes. The target may pay three Willpower to resist, becoming  aware of the hidden clause and able to call on any applicable Intimacies in response. Resisting renders him immune to this Charm for the next (his Essence + Integrity) days. Otherwise, he’s bound to the term — once he becomes aware of it, his mind rationalizes an explanation for how he could have accepted it voluntarily  and why he must honor it, despite having no memory of doing so.

The invitation must be made by a character with customary authority to do so, even if informal — a guest at a noble’s court could extend hospitality to a stranger, and even a palace  servant might welcome her in discreetly, but a thief or trespasser cannot give a valid invitation. As long as the Dragon-Blood and her companions take no hostile actions, other characters cannot violate the guarantee of hospitality without incurring Heaven’s wrath.

To use this Charm, she must have Initiative 15+. A tremendous burst of elemental Essence radiates outward from her, a onetime  environmental hazard that extends to close range, plus an additional range band for every ten Initiative she has. The aspect of this Charm and the hazard’s nature depend on which Elemental Aura she expends. Allies and enemies alike are caught in the hazard, but it won’t harm the Dragon-Blood’s Sworn Kin. If she knows Enfolded in the Dragon’s Wings (p. 282), she may likewise spare allied characters. The hazard has difficulty (the Dragon-Blood’s Intelligence), but doesn’t have a standard damage. Instead, the Dragon-Blood divides her Initiative evenly , rounding up, among all characters who failed their rolls to determine how much lethal damage is rolled against each. Battle groups and trivial opponents instead suffer (her full Initiative) damage, without counting against the total she divides. As long as at least one enemy fails his roll, this resets the Dragon- Blood to base Initiative. The hazard carries additional effects based on its aspect: Air: Roiling storm clouds darken the sky, unleashing countless bolts of lightning and raining down hail. Any character wearing metal armor, including armor made from the magical materials, applies its mobility penalty on his roll to resist the hazard. The damage roll benefits  from double 9s. Earth: The earth rumbles in a mighty earthquake, scattering stone debris skyward to strike flying foes. A character that takes 3+ levels of damage falls into a chasm and lands prone, suffering damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232). Climbing out of the chasm counts as moving through difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199). Fire: A pyroclasm sweeps across the battlefield, igniting  anything flammable. As long as there’s fuel, even after the vortex fades, it leaves behind a hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round within its range, which burns for at least (Intelligence) hours. These flames won’t burn the Dragon-Blood or any allies spared from the vortex. Water: A standing wave towers above the Dragon- Blood before collapsing outward in all directions with tsunami force. For every three levels of damage a character suffers from the hazard, rounded up, he’s knocked back one range band from the Dragon-Blood to fall prone, and suffers an additional three dice of bashing damage, ignoring Hardness. Wood: Fast-growing briar patches and massive thorny vines spread rapidly across the battlefield, while bright-colored flowers bloom with poisonous pollen. Characters who fail their roll must roll (Stamina + Resistance) against a poison with Damage 3i/round, Duration (Essence + Intelligence) rounds, and a −3 penalty. Additionally, the area of the hazard becomes difficult terrain until the plant growth has been cleared entirely. The Dragon-Blood and any allies spared from the vortex are unimpeded by this terrain, the plants parting to clear their path. If any of the Dragon-Blood’s Sworn Kin are within the vortex’s initial range and in Elemental Aura, they may expend it to add that element’s effect to the hazard. The expended Aura must be of an element that hasn’t already been expended; each participating Dragon- Blood must contribute a unique element to the vortex. Crashed Hearthmates can’t contribute their Aura. Each Hearthmate who expends his Aura adds +1 to the hazard’s Difficulty and adds his Initiative to the primary Dragon- Blood’s total to determine both the range and damage of the hazard, resetting him to base Initiative. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134).","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"lore":3,"essence":1},"prereq":["Elemental Concentration Trance"],"charm-skill":"Lore","charm-name":"Deadly Essence Flashpoint","charm-type":"Reflexive","charm-duration":"One scene","charm-cost":"1m per die","rep-cost-mote":1,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"DB : Heirs to the Shogunate","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"on","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Stackable","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Dragon-Blood inverts the destructive force of her anima banner, drawing it inward and letting it build unto a terrifying strength.

Her anima banner flares to bonfire, straining with barely -contained force that mounts over the course of five hours. During this time, the Dragon-Blood can’t take any non-reflexive actions or movement actions. Anyone who can see her anima banner can tell that disaster is imminent; a difficulty 2 ([Intelligence or Perception] + Occult roll) reveals exactly how much time remains. The Dragon-Blood’s anima collapses, dispersing harmlessly , if she leaves Aura or is crashed, incapacitated, or forcibly moved by an enemy. After five hours uninterrupted, the Dragon-Blood expends  her Aura and rolls (Intelligence + Lore), unleashing  a blast that extends (successes/2) miles outwards. She and her Hearthmates are immune to the blast’s immediate consequences; she can use Enfolded in the Dragon’s Wings (Dragon-Blooded, p. 282) to grant the same protection to all allied characters within medium range. The Storyteller determines how much damage the blast inflicts on mundane scenery and trivial opponents , up to uncountable damage. Affected battle groups must check for rout against difficulty 4. The blast’s other effects depend on its elemental aspect: Air: The sky darkens, pouring down harsh rain or heavy snowfall accompanied by gale-force winds and flashing lightning. • Precipitation imposes a –2 penalty on all vision- or hearing-based rolls. • Winds impose a –3 penalty on movement actions, ranged attacks, and similar rolls. • Airborne characters and trivial opponents treat all movement as difficult terrain. • Characters exposed to the storm suffer an environmental  hazard with difficulty 2, Damage 10L/hour; a failed roll indicates they’ve been struck by lightning. The storm lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, but can be dispersed earlier through magic or the creative actions of characters. Earth: The land shakes and grinds horrifically as seismic  tremors shudder through it. • All characters within range must make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Athletics) balance roll or fall into a yawning chasm, suffering falling damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232) unless they find a way to mitigate it. Climbing out requires a difficulty 3 ([Dexterity or Strength] + Athletics) roll, although characters may escape by other means, such as Monkey Leap Technique. • The damage wrought by the earthquake renders the entire area difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199), and the speed of any long-range travel through the affected area is halved. Fire: A roaring conflagration engulfs the land, setting the world ablaze. • All characters suffer a one-time environmental hazard  with difficulty 5, Damage 6L. • Forests, grasslands, wooden structures, and other flammable terrain catches fire and continues to burn with a lesser intensity (difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round) until they’re extinguished or no fuel remains. • A haze of smoke and ash hangs over the affected area, imposing a –2 penalty on any vision- or scentbased  rolls. This lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, unless dispersed earlier by natural weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters, and may last longer if large regions remain  ablaze. Water: A swirling pillar of water descends from the sky or rises from the sea, before dispersing in all directions as a crushing tidal wave. • Depending on a character’s proximity to the Dragon- Blood, the amount of time they have to prepare for the wave’s impact varies — those within long range are struck by it instantly, without an opportunity to seek cover, while someone miles away from her might have minutes to prepare. • Characters unable to reach a place of safety before  being hit must make a difficulty 5 ([Strength or Stamina] + Athletics) roll to avoid being carried away. If they fail, they’re knocked one range band away from the Dragon-Blood per success they failed by. If this movement is interrupted by hitting a barrier, the character takes damage as though he’d suffered a fall from a height equal to the number of range bands of movement prevented. • Ships caught in this wave suffer ten dice of Hull damage . Captains can roll (Wits + Sail) to avoid the worst of it, subtracting one die of damage per success. • The blast is also likely to cause mass flooding in valleys  and similar areas. Wood: Gigantic vines burst from the ground, bearing vibrant flowers that bloom with toxic pollen. • The overgrowth renders the entire area difficult terrain and halves the speed of long-term travel through it, although travelers can potentially bypass this by setting fire to the vines or destroying them through other means. • Pollen imposes a –3 penalty on scent-based rolls. • The pollen is also an inhaled poison. The first time a character breathes in the affected area, and after each hour of exposure thereafter, they must roll against a poison with Damage 1B/minute, Duration 10 minutes, and a –3 penalty. The vines remain until destroyed, but their flowers wilt after (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, ending the pollen haze. It can be dispersed earlier by natural  weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters. The Dragon-Blood’s Hearthmates can contribute their Auras to this Charm, as long as they remain within short range and abide the same restrictions she does. Only one Aura of each element can be contributed, adding a non-Charm die on the Lore roll and conferring  that element’s effects on the blast. The effects of different elements will combine without cancelling one another — Water and Fire, for example, would combine to unleash a scalding tsunami hot enough to set the battlefield afire. After using this Charm, the Dragon-Blood and all Hearthmates that contributed Auras suffer a –4 fatigue penalty on all rolls. Each full night’s rest lowers the penalty  by one; until it’s fully removed, affected characters can’t regain Willpower from rest. This Charm can only be used once per story or year, whichever is longer.

This Charm is a dramatic action to prepare for an upcoming battle by rounding up a herd of horses or other wild, ridable animals — even blundering yeddim. This is a series of (Charisma + Ride) rolls, which are treated as rally for numbers actions (Exalted, p. 209), building up the Magnitude of animals that the Dragon-Blood has gathered. Each roll takes five minutes of animal calls, handling, or impressive stunts to complete. Once the Dragon-Blood has built up enough Magnitude to form a Size 1 battle group, she may continue making rally rolls to increase the group’s Size, up to a maximum of Size 3. Concealing the approach of this stampeding herd is impossible without large-scale magic. The herd isn’t treated as a battle group in combat. Instead, when the Dragon-Blood rolls Join Battle, it stampedes across the battlefield, imposing a penalty equal to (its Size) on all enemy Join Battle rolls, before dispersing. Every enemy whose Join Battle roll is beaten  by the Dragon-Blood’s takes decisive damage as the stampede tramples over them. She divides (Initiative + stampede’s Size) dice of bashing damage evenly among the victims (round up), ignoring Hardness. Trivial opponents  and battle groups instead take the full (Initiative + Size) damage roll, which doesn’t detract from the total divided among other enemies. This attack resets the Dragon-Blood to base Initiative once it’s completed. The Dragon-Blood may learn elemental variants of this Charm for three experience points each. While she’s in appropriate terrain, she may rouse that element’s natural perils instead of wild animals. She still rolls to build up its effective Size for determining the Join Battle penalty and total damage inflicted, but this represents  the force of nature that follows her, growing stronger as she rides. Air: Riding through snow-covered land, the Dragon- Blood trails an avalanche behind her. Any enemy that takes decisive damage on the initial roll is hurled one range band away from the Dragon-Blood and falls prone. The numbing cold imposes a penalty equal to the avalanche’s Size on all movement rolls a damaged character makes until he receives medical treatment as a difficulty 3 (Intelligence + Medicine) roll. Earth: Charging across mountainsides or stony terrain, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a rockslide that follows in her wake. Any enemy that takes decisive damage on the initial roll is hurled one range band away from the Dragon-Blood and falls prone, covered in rubble. A buried character or one of his allies must succeed on a Strength 3 feat of strength at difficulty 3 to clear the rubble before he can attempt to rise from prone. Fire: Riding over dry grass or other parched foliage, the Dragon-Blood ignites a roaring grass fire that follows  in her wake. A bonfire (4L/round, difficulty 5) ignites  at the feet of each enemy that that takes decisive damage from the initial roll. At the Storyteller’s discretion , flammable scenery may also catch fire as long as no character is present in the same space. These fires burn until the end of the scene unless put out. Water: The Dragon-Blood may ride with a river, coastline, or similar body of water at her back, running along the riverbed until the river runs with her. As she Joins Battle, it changes its course to spill over onto the battlefield, positioned by the Storyteller to benefit the Dragon-Blooded. Its largest dimension is at least (Size/2, rounded up) range bands long, from a starting point determined by the Storyteller.

Barricade (4 point): The Dragon-Blood wrenches up great masses of earth and compresses them into barriers or walls, instantly enacting a Fortifications stratagem (Exalted, p. 212). Sapping (7 points): If an enemy general has successfully  employed a Fortifications stratagem, the Dragon- Blood may negate its benefits by tunneling through earth and stone, or otherwise creating ways to bypass the fortifications. The Dragon-Blood’s forces don’t treat the terrain as difficult, and may reflexively advance  one range band towards the enemy forces. The Storyteller may also adjudicate additional advantages depending on the context of the battlefield. Reshape Battlefield (10 points): If the Dragon-Blood has successfully enacted a Strategic Placement stratagem (Exalted, p. 212), she may resculpt the battlefield to her specifications, preparing it before the battle and ensuring her enemy will fight her there. She might prepare rows of trenches and fortified towers of earth for her own forces, while forcing her enemy to traverse pits filled with stone spikes, narrow stone tunnels, and similar obstacles. The Storyteller adjudicates the specific effects of these creations . She cannot directly harm foes with the moving stone, although she can create all types of traps and dangers.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"war":5,"essence":3},"prereq":[],"charm-skill":"War","charm-name":"Deadly Wildfire Legion","charm-type":"Supplemental","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"5m, 1wp, expend Fire Aura","rep-cost-mote":5,"rep-cost-will":1,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"DB Core","charm-aspect":"fire","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Aura","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"A raging nimbus of flames surrounds the Dragon- Blood’s forces, manifesting her martial prowess as she urges them onward.

Someone who can’t find a consenting partner instead engages in artistic or athletic displays to attract one.

She claims a single contiguous region no more than (Essence x 10) square miles as her territory. To do so, she must fully master the land she wishes to claim. She must physically traverse the majority of the region. Any mortal communities living in the territory must accept her presence — they need not make her their leader, but must acknowledge her presence and that they lack the ability or desire to force her out. Finally, if any supernatural beings — such as spirits or fellow Exalted — occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Lunar must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. Land already claimed by another Lunar’s Boundary- Marking Meditation can’t be taken from him unless he voluntarily relinquishes it or dies. Upon claiming a territory, the Lunar’s player chooses three qualities that describe it, e.g. fertile, shadowy, and dense for a thick forest, or open, windy, and guarded for a steppe village. When a character within the territory takes an action that’s supported by any of these qualities, like foraging in a fertile woodland, he’s treated as having an applicable specialty. When a character takes an action opposed by a quality, like a general enacting a Strategic Maneuver roll to march a large army through the dense forest, each such quality  imposes a −1 penalty. The Lunar never suffers these penalties. She can reflexively render a character she perceives immune to her territory’s penalties, or deny him its benefits. Story events may cause a territory to lose qualities — if the forest burns down, it’s no longer shadowy or dense.

The Lunar spends five days laboring  to create a testing ground in a demesne or the Wyld: meditating, performing austerities, bargaining with spirits, etching occult geoglyphs, etc. It’s imbued with the Essence of the Lunar’s spirit shape; a mortal who successfully completes  its trial receives six dots of mutations reflecting that animal, chosen by the Lunar when she uses this Charm. Lunars with Chimera-Soul Expression (p. 143) choose two sets of mutations per trial ground, reflecting both animals making up their spirit shape; successful participants receive whichever best fits their personality and their triumph’s nature. These mutations are hereditary, letting Lunars establish great beastfolk lineages. The Lunar doesn’t choose the trial’s nature; it emerges from her spirit shape’s nature and the Essence of the demesne or the Wyld. Her player should work with the Storyteller to determine what form the trial takes. It might be a challenge of physical, social, or mental prowess; a test of character or Intimacies; or an ordeal with no single solution. Whatever form it takes, failure carries significant consequences — not necessarily death, but maiming, curses, Derangements, and other afflictions are all possible. A character can only attempt  a single such trial ever, pass or fail — she can’t subsequently benefit from other trial grounds, even those created by different Lunars. These factors limit the creation of beastfolk en masse. If the Lunar ends this Charm before the story she used it in ends, the testing ground loses its power. Once the story ends, the testing ground becomes permanent, no longer requiring committed motes and persisting past the Lunar’s death. However, testing grounds can be destroyed by building manses over their demesnes, or by permanently shaping the Wyld containing them into Creation with magic such as Wyld-Shaping Technique. (Harmony-With-Reality Technique won’t destroy testing grounds.) A Lunar can’t have more than (Intelligence + Willpower) permanent testing grounds.

For illnesses, this a disease spirit (Exalted, p. 509). For poisons, the Storyteller can alter a disease spirit’s traits to reflect poison, use another appropriate spirit’s traits, or invent new traits. The spirit’s power is commensurate  with that of the ailment he originated from, though his Essence can’t exceed the Lunar’s. The spirit has a Defining Tie of loyalty toward the Lunar, which can’t be weakened or altered for a season .

Once the spirit’s season of service elapses, he no longer provides these benefits. The Lunar can only have one spirit bound with this Charm at a time; binding a new one requires releasing any previous spirit from his season of service. A Lunar with Midnight Soul Reprieve (p. 201) can use this Charm after lowering a patient’s Derangement from Defining to Minor intensity, fully curing her patient and expelling that Derangement as a spirit. A Derangement spirit’s advice counts as exceptional equipment, as above, and waives the Willpower cost of using Midnight Soul Reprieve to treat the same Derangement.

Anyone that can see both the Lunar and her victim suffers a −2 penalty on rolls to spot the Lunar’s Tell or distinguish the false Tell.

She gains its heart’s blood as a retroactive sacred hunt, and must pay the cost to shapeshift into it, muting the cost. This can only be used to replace narratively unimportant  characters, and never powerful beings such as Exalted or spirits — in a scene set at a prince’s court, the Lunar couldn’t replace the prince, one of his trusted viziers, or the captain of the palace guard, but could replace a servant or a rank-and-file guard. She couldn’t declare that the rogue yeddim stampeding through Nexus is actually her, but could reveal that she’s been the songbird singing from a tree, or a fly buzzing around a satrap’s meal (assuming she has Emerald Grasshopper Form). For the scene’s duration, characters cannot roll to read her intentions, profile her, or spot her Tell — her presence there is proof she hasn’t been found out. Only Eye of the Unconquered Sun or similarly mighty magic can reveal her. If the Lunar initiates hostilities after using this Charm, she may potentially launch an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). This Charm represents the Lunar’s deft skill at infiltration  and impersonation. If the Storyteller deems it implausible for her to appear in a scene — for example, if it’s set in a fortress whose guards are on the lookout for shapeshifters, or the manse of a Dragon-Blood with potent Awareness and Investigation Charms — he may require a (Manipulation + [Larceny, Socialize, or Stealth]) roll against an appropriate difficulty to succeed, maximum 10. Successfully circumventing an Imperial military camp’s guards might be difficulty 2-4, depending on the quality of the troops posted, while sneaking under the notice of an all-seeing Solar or infiltrating a meeting of gods and Sidereals might be difficulty 10. On a failed roll, she’s unable to enter the scene. Even if successful, she must still explain how she’s insinuated herself into it. However, assuming the Lunar succeeds on the roll and contrives an appropriate  explanation, there are no circumstances whereby it’s truly impossible for her to infiltrate a scene as long as a viable candidate for replacement is present. This Charm can only be used once per story. An Essence 5 repurchase requires False Moonrise Phantasm, and lets the Lunar pay a fifteen-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm in scenes where she’s already present. In addition to replacing another character present in the scene, she reveals that the person that seemed to be her was someone else that the Lunar passed off as a perfect duplicate of herself  at some point during the last round.

Astrology at a Distance When a Sidereal uses an Ascending (Caste) Horoscope or Descending (Caste) Horoscope on a Storyteller character, the Storyteller doesn’t need to meticulous track everything that character does offscreen — instead, she can portray the blessing or curse’s effects narratively, as with prophecies (p. XX). Cursing a scavenger prince seeking to plunder the same ruins as a rival with Descending Journeys Horoscope might delay him reaching the ruins, causing him to get there at the same time or after as his rival. It might also cause him to reach his journey’s end much worse for the wear than normally.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"essence":1},"prereq":["Any Journeys Charm"],"charm-skill":"The House of Journeys","charm-name":"Honest Face Spirit","charm-type":"Reflexive","charm-duration":"One scene","charm-cost":"3m","rep-cost-mote":3,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Sidereals","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":1,"charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Sidereal is easily trusted, distinguished by fate from her shiftless and unreliable fellows.

If the Sidereal succeeds, the disaster occurs at the next dramatically appropriate sunrise or sunset. Though it comes early, it’s diminished or flawed in some way that gives the Sidereal a significant advantage in overcoming it, taking into consideration the reduced time to prepare for it. A mutiny occurs before her entire crew turns against her; the assassin sent against her turns out to be mortal rather than an outcaste; a hurricane befalls her ship while it’s near a refuge where the storm can be more easily weathered.

All her Thrown Charms count as Versatile for that style and as Martial Arts for any of its Charms that interact with other styles, like Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form (p. XX). This Charm can be purchased any number of times.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"thrown":5,"essence":3},"prereq":["Unmoved Mover Principle"],"charm-skill":"Thrown — The Gull","charm-name":"Three-Body Trilemma","charm-type":"Reflexive","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"10m, 1i, 1wp","rep-cost-mote":10,"rep-cost-will":1,"rep-cost-init":1,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Sidereals","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Decisive-only, Versatile","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Sidereal’s weapon intertwines her fate with her foe’s, making them indistinguishable to the world’s eyes.

If successful, both of them vanish from the battlefield, reappearing in a vast cavern, full of shadows and thorns, whose location is known only to Mercury. The distance between the two of them remains unchanged. The combatants return to the world once the scene ends, when one of them is incapacitated, or if neither wish to continue fighting. They can also escape by successfully withdrawing from combat (Exalted, p. 199), finding a secret path out of the cavern. The cavern is wide open, allowing the vanished combats to move freely across it in any direction. At the Storyteller’s discretion, it may include difficult terrain — stalagmites, briars, etc. — or other natural features. Some claim to have seen strange ghosts within it, though this is unsubstantiated.

This secondary target must be chosen before the gambit’s attack roll; if it doesn’t beat his Defense, this Charm has no effect.

When the Sidereal’s focus applies, she waives the mote cost to lower target numbers for rolls with any Ability using Excellencies.

The Sidereal can’t don the resplendent destiny while it’s imbued, but it still counts against her limit. The imbued object takes on a semblance more suited to the destiny’s roll and becomes an artifact, though it doesn’t become indestructible. (Non-weapon, non-armor artifacts typically have an attunement cost of two motes and have an attunement bonus comparable to those of other artifacts.) Those who wield or wear the artifact are wreathed in its resplendent destiny, suppressing those of other Sidereals. Evocations can be awakened from the imbued destiny, based on its role and constellation and the Sidereal’s Caste. Sidereals are resonant with them; other characters treat them as exotic materials (Arms of the Chosen, p. 15). If the imbued object is destroyed, characters can still use awakened Evocations if the Sidereal imbues the same resplendent destiny in another object. As long as a character’s awakened an Evocation for that resplendent destiny, the destiny never fades at the end of a story and can’t be magically destroyed, though the Sidereal can voluntarily end it. If she does, or if she dies or otherwise leaves the narrative, player characters are refunded experience spent on these Evocations.

This lasts for a year and a day, after which the blight reforms at the region's center and begins spreading back to its original boundaries. At the Storyteller's discretion, rituals, wards, geomantic engineering, and other mystical practices may be able to contain the blight after this time expires, potentially even permanently. This is especially true if these measures are based on facts introduced by the players or have been enacted through a successful project (Exalted, p. 226).

Her withering or decisive attack is undodgeable. 10s on the attack roll adds one die of post-soak withering damage or decisive damage, up to a maximum of her extra successes. A damaged enemy is knocked prone and pinned beneath the boulder; he can’t rise from prone until it’s been lifted with a difficulty 5 feat of strength that requires Strength 3. Fire (Decisive-only): The Sidereal’s arrow transforms into a rain of fire. She must have Initiative 12+ to use this transformation. Her decisive attack is unblockable. As long as she deals any damage, her target any characters within close range of him whose Evasion is beaten by the attack roll catch flame, suffering (Essence) dice of lethal damage at the start of each of their turns until the flames are extinguished. Flammable scenery may likewise catch flame. Glass (Dual): The Sidereal’s arrow turns into perfectly translucent glass. Her withering or decisive attack becomes a surprise attack (Exalted, p. 203). If she does so on her first turn against a lower-Initiative enemy, he rolls (Perception + Awareness) opposing her attack roll. If he fails, it becomes an ambush. Grain (Special): A field of ripe wheat sprouts from where the Sidereal’s arrow falls. She makes a special (Intelligence + Archery) attack roll. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. The grain provides enough food to feed a group of people with one dot of effective Size (Exalted, p. 206) for every two successes, rounded up. This transformation can only be used once per day. Life (Special): The Sidereal’s arrow transforms into a bolt of vital Essence. She makes a special (Intelligence + Archery) attack roll to align this with the flows of her patient’s Essence. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. For each success, she may pay 3 Initiative to heal one level of non-aggravated damage. A character can only benefit from this gambit once per day.

The snowfall extends out to (Essence + successes) miles from where her arrow landed — any point within her weapon’s range — and lasts for a number of hours equal to her successes.

Additional options can be purchased for one bonus point or three experience points apiece. Baleful Phantom Harbinger (The Mask): The Sidereal observes her target without him being aware of her. Hubris-Punishing Downfall (The Sorcerer): The Sidereal’s target disrespects, insults, or expresses feelings of superiority to a supernatural being. Nine Lives Extinguished (The Key): The Sidereal’s target tries to uncover a secret she’s keeping, her nature as a Sidereal, or details about her personal life she doesn’t want to share with him. Serpent-Strangling Malison (The Guardians): The Sidereal’s target lies to her or tries to cheat or take advantage of her. Willful Ignorance Reward (The Treasure Trove): The Sidereal’s target ignores advice he sought from her about intellectual pursuits, useful information to pursue, or the application of knowledge. She becomes aware when he does so and can use this Charm reflexively. The Sidereal can curse multiple characters with this Charm.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"essence":1},"prereq":["Any Secrets Charm"],"charm-skill":"The House of Secrets","charm-name":"Ascending Destiny Mien","charm-type":"Permanent","charm-duration":"Permanent","charm-cost":"—","rep-cost-mote":0,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Sidereals","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Sidereal gets on her formidable intellect in delicate negotiations and clandestine intrigues, employing deductive reasoning to plot out a path through a conversation.

It can’t answer questions involving speculation, matters of opinion, or subjective judgments, nor does it have any insight into supernatural powers or people’s thoughts, plans, and emotions. It also can’t reveal any information that anyone’s taken efforts to conceal, nor can it reveal information if it’s not known to anyone in existence. Examples of information the secretary can provide straightforwardly include the name of the local carpenter, how long ago a widow’s wife died, how many oxen an old friend owns, or the temperature of in Nexus. A question like “what’s the Bull of the North doing?” will typically give an accurate but not useful result, as the secretary can’t ascertain the Solar’s intentions or speculate as to the purpose of his current activities. Questions like “who’s winning this war?” or “which of these two men is more beautiful” are too speculative or subjective for the secretary to answer; it can only chitter its apologies. This Charm may be repurchased any number of times, each repurchase adding an Evocation to the Sidereal’s secretary that can expand the range of its information gathering and talent as an assistant.

The Sidereal’s player proposes a general description of the fate that will befall him if she succeeds, though that doom’s severity won’t be determined until after she rolls. Her victim’s Intimacies modify his Resolve against the Sidereal’s roll if they support or oppose the doom. Success assures that the victim’s doom will come to pass. The Sidereal’s player finalizes the details of that doom.

The Sidereal must commit this Charm’s cost for this interval; if she ends it prematurely or is killed, the doom subsides from an inevitability to a mere possibility. The doom is sure to happen, though the specifics may vary from the player’s description based on how events unfold in play, but fate will adapt to whatever happens to ensure her victim faces that doom in some meaningful form. However, the victim can mitigate the overall harm and impact of this doom with successful rolls, creative thinking, assistance from his allies, and other assets. This prophecy can influence the lives and decisions of mortal characters in addition to its target as necessary to bring that doom to pass but can’t force the Exalted and other supernatural beings to do anything unless their player agrees.

The Sidereal vanishes, reappearing in a location chosen by the Storyteller where she can start a new life in a way that will advance the chronicle’s story. Her player creates a new identity appropriate to this locale; this can be a mortal, an Exalt, a spirit, or another supernatural creature, though she can’t imitate specific characters. The Sidereal rolls (Manipulation + Stealth) to determine her cover identity’s social context, choosing Story Merits whose total rating equals her successes.

The specifics of the relationship a character remembers having with the Sidereal’s cover identity should be determined between that character’s player and the Sidereal’s. If a nontrivial character discovers evidence his memories have been altered, he may pay three Willpower to reject the false memories. • She takes on the physical appearance of her cover identity, and any overt magic she uses takes on a suitable appearance. This includes her anima banner; it won’t rise above dim in un- Exalted cover identities. Seeing through this disguise is impossible without magic like Eye of the Unconquered Sun (Exalted, p. 273). Divination, scrying, and similar magic won’t provide information that contradicts her cover identity. • Characters automatically fail rolls opposing the Sidereal’s Guile that could contradict her cover identity unless they use magic or have a Tie to the Sidereal’s true identity; even then, they suffer +2 target number. • Her cover identity takes the place of a resplendent destiny, suppressing her arcane fate but preventing her from donning other destinies — unless her cover identity’s also a Sidereal. • If she disguises herself as a supernatural being, she can learn Eclipse Charms appropriate to its nature. She retains them even after this Charm ends, though she must wear a resplendent destiny of that type of being to use them. • All Psyche effects, Shaping effects, sorcerous curses, and other harmful ongoing magic she suffers from at the time she uses this Charm are suppressed for its duration. • If she knows Self-Annihilating Discretion, she may use it for free with this Charm to erase memories as appropriate to her new cover identity, without needing a roll. These changes revert when this Charm ends. • If she knows Death-of-Self Meditation (p. XX), she may exchange any number of her Intimacies for new Intimacies of equal intensity appropriate to her cover identity. These remain even after this Charm ends. Once this Charm ends, the cover identity begins to unravel. The disguise itself ends immediately; memories of the cover identity fade away with each passing hour, gone entirely in a matter of days.
