Astrology at a Distance When a Sidereal uses an Ascending (Caste) Horoscope or Descending (Caste) Horoscope on a Storyteller character, the Storyteller doesn’t need to meticulous track everything that character does offscreen — instead, she can portray the blessing or curse’s effects narratively, as with prophecies (p. XX). Cursing a scavenger prince seeking to plunder the same ruins as a rival with Descending Journeys Horoscope might delay him reaching the ruins, causing him to get there at the same time or after as his rival. It might also cause him to reach his journey’s end much worse for the wear than normally.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"essence":1},"prereq":["Any Journeys Charm"],"charm-skill":"The House of Journeys","charm-name":"Honest Face Spirit","charm-type":"Reflexive","charm-duration":"One scene","charm-cost":"3m","rep-cost-mote":3,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Sidereals","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":1,"charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Sidereal is easily trusted, distinguished by fate from her shiftless and unreliable fellows.

This Charm can only be used on the Sidereal’s familiars, her mortal Allies, Contacts, Cult, Followers, Mentors, and Retainers, and characters she’s used Breaking the Wild Mortal on. Affixing the prayer strip requires a difficulty 1 Brawl or Martial Arts gambit against an unwilling character. The Sidereal’s victim has a chance to tear it from his forehead before the transformation is complete. If he isn’t restrained, no roll is required; otherwise, he reflexively rolls (Dexterity + Athletics) or another appropriate pool a difficulty set by the Storyteller. If he fails, he’s too late, and the transformation sets in. A transformed character becomes a lesser elemental dragon of air or water (p. XX), the Scripture of the Desirable Maiden spelled out along his back. He gains a Defining Tie of obedience to the Sidereal and loses all other Intimacies. In combat, he immediately rolls Join Battle, replacing his previous Initiative. The Sidereal’s victim reverts to his true form once this Charm ends, but he is far from unscathed. The immense spiritual toll the transformation exacts causes grievous and permanent damage to his soul and identity. The Storyteller determines the specifics: he fall into a coma, suffer total amnesia, etc. It may be possible to undo this with magic like Soul Projection Method (Exalted, p. 358).

The ship can travel over what would be dry land and always enjoys Speed bonuses from currents and wind, but it’s impossible to perceive Creation from the ship or deliberately navigate toward a destination; instead, the ship’s journey ends at a destination that will prove beneficial to the Sidereal or her Circle’s goals or to someone she wishes to help.

Other Sidereals using Mirror-Shattering Method can interact with the ship; magic like Silver Curtain Parted (Lunars, p. 249) can let characters board the ship if they detect it.

Upon learning of some future danger, suffering, or disaster that she’s likely to face in the future, the Sidereal rolls (Intelligence + Sail) to ensure it happens sooner than normally would.

If the disaster is the result of magic like God-King’s Shrike, she makes an opposed roll instead.

If the Sidereal succeeds, the disaster occurs at the next dramatically appropriate sunrise or sunset. Though it comes early, it’s diminished or flawed in some way that gives the Sidereal a significant advantage in overcoming it, taking into consideration the reduced time to prepare for it. A mutiny occurs before her entire crew turns against her; the assassin sent against her turns out to be mortal rather than an outcaste; a hurricane befalls her ship while it’s near a refuge where the storm can be more easily weathered. Overcoming the challenge counts as fulfilling an auspicious prospect (p. XX). Additionally, fate ensures the Sidereal won’t face a similar peril for a year and a day, barring magical intervention.

Her withering or decisive attack is undodgeable. 10s on the attack roll adds one die of post-soak withering damage or decisive damage, up to a maximum of her extra successes. A damaged enemy is knocked prone and pinned beneath the boulder; he can’t rise from prone until it’s been lifted with a difficulty 5 feat of strength that requires Strength 3. Fire (Decisive-only): The Sidereal’s arrow transforms into a rain of fire. She must have Initiative 12+ to use this transformation. Her decisive attack is unblockable.

If she does so on her first turn against a lower-Initiative enemy, he rolls (Perception + Awareness) opposing her attack roll. If he fails, it becomes an ambush. Grain (Special): A field of ripe wheat sprouts from where the Sidereal’s arrow falls. She makes a special (Intelligence + Archery) attack roll. This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. The grain provides enough food to feed a group of people with one dot of effective Size (Exalted, p. 206) for every two successes, rounded up. This transformation can only be used once per day.

This doesn’t count as her attack for the round. For each success, she may pay 3 Initiative to heal one level of non-aggravated damage. A character can only benefit from this gambit once per day.

The snowfall extends out to (Essence + successes) miles from where her arrow landed — any point within her weapon’s range — and lasts for a number of hours equal to her successes.

Once the battle ends, the Sidereal rolls (Charisma + War) against a specific god or elemental with Essence up to the Sidereal’s own. She may add either the highest (Essence/2, rounded up) among supernatural characters who died in that battle or the highest Might among battle groups that lost dots of Size or faced other losses to the maximum Essence of spirit she can summon. The chosen spirit appears on the battlefield. If the Sidereal’s roll succeeds against his Resolve, she has two options. She may demand a single favor from him, which he’ll perform dutifully, forming a Defining Principle to completing that task which can’t be altered or weakened until its done. Most spirits consider this a fair exchange for the Sidereal’s offering; only if she demands a truly unreasonable favor will the spirit hold a grudge against her for asking. Alternatively, she can bind the spirit to her for a year and a day, imposing a Defining Tie of loyalty to her that can’t be altered or weakened during that time. Almost all spirits will consider this a grievous offense; one must be truly desperate for worship to gladly accept this as the price of the Sidereal’s offering. Historically, the most common form of reprisal for this has been efforts to bind Sidereal offenders into similar servitude, though it’s far from the only one. Special activation rules: The Sidereal may use this Charm when an allied battle group loses a dot of Size or fails a rout check.

It can’t answer questions involving speculation, matters of opinion, or subjective judgments, nor does it have any insight into supernatural powers or people’s thoughts, plans, and emotions. It also can’t reveal any information that anyone’s taken efforts to conceal, nor can it reveal information if it’s not known to anyone in existence.

The Sidereal’s player proposes a general description of the fate that will befall him if she succeeds, though that doom’s severity won’t be determined until after she rolls. Her victim’s Intimacies modify his Resolve against the Sidereal’s roll if they support or oppose the doom. Success assures that the victim’s doom will come to pass.

During this time, he can seek to break the prophecy with applicable magic or prepare for his doom. The Sidereal must commit this Charm’s cost for this interval; if she ends it prematurely or is killed, the doom subsides from an inevitability to a mere possibility. The doom is sure to happen, though the specifics may vary from the player’s description based on how events unfold in play, but fate will adapt to whatever happens to ensure her victim faces that doom in some meaningful form. However, the victim can mitigate the overall harm and impact of this doom with successful rolls, creative thinking, assistance from his allies, and other assets. This prophecy can influence the lives and decisions of mortal characters in addition to its target as necessary to bring that doom to pass but can’t force the Exalted and other supernatural beings to do anything unless their player agrees.
