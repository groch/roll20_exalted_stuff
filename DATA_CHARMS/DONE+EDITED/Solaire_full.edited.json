If Searing Sunfire Interdiction drops the target to a tick of 0 or less, he loses his turn for the round. Searing Sunfire Interdiction cannot be used on the same target twice consecutively. An Essence 3+ repurchase of this Charm lowers the difficulty of the gambit to 2 and waives the Initiative cost upon success. An Essence 4+ repurchase of the upgraded Charm resets the Solar’s attack if she drops an opponent from a higher Initiative tick to a lower Initiative tick than her own. An Essence 5+ repurchase of the second upgrade allows the Solar to use Searing Sunfire Interdiction twice consecutively on the same target, dropping the Willpower cost from the second shot. If the Solar delays her opponent with both shots, he’s also forced backwards a range band, even if this would force him off a cliff or a rooftop. An Essence 6+ repurchase of the previous upgrade allows the Lawgiver to use this gambit repeatedly against a single target: each time she successfully hits with this gambit, she may immediately fire the gambit again, so long as she has ammunition. If she misses or forces her target to lose a turn, the Charm ends. As with the previous upgrade, waive the willpower cost from all but the first shot. If the Solar stops an opponent from acting, award her a point of Willpower. As above, for every two shots the opponent is delayed, he’s forced back a range band.

Naming it off limits, she fires a scintillating shot high into the air. Her arrow flies up and up and does not come down unless the opponent crosses through, over, or into the designated position, at which point they become subject to a decisive attack with the Solar’s unmodified attack pool, and with damage equal to the Initiative she had the moment she fired the shot. In addition , this shot is enhanced by the prerequisite at no extra charge. If Hanging Judgment Arc succeeds at damaging the target, the Solar’s Initiative does not return to base. If the Exalt is crashed, slain, or the scene ends without the attack being triggered, the arrow comes down and will set fire to any flammable thing it touches. Any use of this Charm must occur in places with enough vertical space to fire an arrow upward without it getting lodged in the ceiling. The player can’t threat-mark an area inside an enclosed building or chamber while standing outside. Special activation rules: If the Lawgiver threatens a specific character with this attack, (ie “Winglord Kvetu may not retreat across that bridge”) the attack gains [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic successes, [[@{essence}]](Essence) bonus dice, and [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic damage successes. At Archery 5+, Essence 3+, the Lawgiver may use this Charm out of combat for eight motes, setting the Charm’s duration to Indefinite, and giving it a base damage of 17. With Archery 5+ Essence 4+, the out-of-combat use becomes Stackable up to [[@{essence}]](Essence) times. These bans do not end if the Solar is crashed or slain, only if the threat is triggered or the Lawgiver ends her commitment. On Hanging Judgment Arc The backer had a really awesome name and idea for an Archery Charm, but execution was trickier than it looked. In case you are wondering, if you mark an area where your ally is standing when an enemy triggers the attack, the attack is precise enough to only hit the enemy . But whether or not they both catch on fire is a totally different issue. Backer: Andrew Bartkus",

The explosion has an attack pool of the Solar’s Initiative (maximum 10 dice), and rolls decisive damage equal to the Solar’s Initiative. If this attack is successful against at least one enemy, then it resets the Solar’s Initiative to base. It can expressly be used to blow up inanimate objects, scenery, and siege weaponry without affecting the Solar’s Initiative. All characters struck by this attack are knocked out of the exploded range band and land prone, losing one Initiative each, not transferred to the Solar. Characters blown down by this Charm have no control over where they land; characters who dodge this explosion are automatically knocked to the next range band, but they do not lose Initiative nor do they fall to prone, simply rolling to their feet or skidding along on their heels without losing balance. If used to damage a battle group, Nova Arrow Attack causes disarray and panic, applying a -2 success penalty to its next attack. On Nova Arrow Attack The natural evolution of Fiery Arrow Attack, I wanted to do this Charm originally, but was too pressed for time to come up with a balanced explosion mechanic.

The difficulty of this roll is 5.

The blast from this explosion can only be dodged, and has the same knockdown rules as Nova Arrow Attack. In addition, characters knocked down by this attack are automatically lit on fire, suffering bonfire (4L/round) damage until they can put it out.

A character struck with this attack is likewise flung backwards one range band for every three health levels lost from the attack.

If she uses it against a battle group, they are automatically at -2 successes from their next rout check. Solar Judgment Flare can be used without an aim action. On Solar Judgment Flare The backer is brand new to Exalted, so I had to help him find the exact right Charm. The first couple of Resistance Charms we worked on didn’t feel right to his personality, so we scrapped them. Finally I asked him what characters he likes most, and he started to talk about an overpowered archer from Fate Stay/Night. I had known since the beginning that Archery yet needed an overpowered Charm, so I worked out this incredibly powerful mechanic.

Once she is within combat range of an opponent, attacking is sufficient enough movement to keep her airborne. If she is a ranged fighter, she may also use Unbound Eagle Approach, paying two motes in order to hang in the air, planing along an air current as she takes an aim action. Lastly, the Solar can also channel a burst of speed for two motes, allowing her to rush or disengage from appropriate distances. If she fails to activate the Charm, gets knocked off-course or otherwise begins to fall, Eagle-Wing Style cannot be reactivated until she touches down and is able to leap again.

If the Solar has learned Power Suffusing Form Technique (see Exalted, p. 266), she can combine that Charm with this to hurl an ally the size of a horse and rider safely up or forward one range band, or she may toss a human-sized ally forward two range bands. This use adds one Willpower to the cost of this Charm, but drops the mote cost to two. On Strength-Hying Heave The backer wanted something like the “Fastball Special” from Claremont’s run on the Uncanny X-Men, where Colossus hurls Wolverine at a target. I figured, why not let someone with superhuman strength throw a very heavy ally as well? I can already see a player writing in to tell me how their Zenith stood at the end of a dock as the Night rode up on an armored destrier, and they hurled horse and rider onto the deck of a retreating ship. That said, a Solar using Nine Aeons Thew and other Charms might be able to throw an ally three or more range bands, but they will take falling damage unless they have Charms such as Soaring Crane Leap that will help them land safely. This is a good example of how Solar Charms can and do work together in ways that aren’t expressly outlined in the rules. Backer: Mike Gill",

Nor can the Solar benefit from giving her “battle group self” enhanced abilities through the use of War Charms. Each round this Charm is active costs the Solar an additional mote of Essence to keep active. In addition, when the Solar’s Magnitude track fills up with damage and she loses a point of Size, instead of a rout check she is subject to a difficulty 3 Stamina + Athletics roll to maintain the Charm. Ending this Charm gives the Exalt a -1 success fatigue penalty to all of her Athletics rolls for the next three rounds. Faster than Self Technique can only be activated once per scene. On Faster than Self Technique The backer’s friend, Koray Bilgin, is the genius behind this Charm. He came up with the name, the concept, and the framework of the mechanics.

The Solar can recognize an individual by scent alone, and she can tell older scents from new ones, enabling her to tell how recently an individual was present. Add +2 successes to Survival rolls to hunt for food, track a character, or find water, using her sense of smell. This Charm automatically extends the range of these actions to [[ @{essence} * 200 ]](Essence * 200) yards. This Charm also creates a library of scents which your character can reference. Upon learning this Charm, the library is populated with the scents of any Major or Defining Intimacy the character may have, but it can also include scents outside the confines of intimacies if the Storyteller deems them reasonable, including any scent the character has encountered in the last 24 hours, the smell of a favorite food or drink, or scents linked to strong memories such as love or pain. Entries in a Solar’s scent library can be used to aid in Investigation and Survival rolls, as well as in the smell-based Awareness Charms further up the tree. This Charm also creates a taste index. Similar to the scent library, the taste index allows the Exalt to immediately recognize any taste she has experienced within the realm of reason. The Solar can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced most of the flavors at some point in time. The taste index isn’t populated the same way as the scent library; most characters do not have Major or Defining intimacies for flavors. Rather, the Solar may perfectly recognize any flavor the Storyteller considers reasonable. If the charac- ter has been a master chef all of her life, her palate is going to be considerably more robust than that of an islander with little contact with the outside world. Conversely, those who have lived or traveled in remote locations may have had access to rare and exotic food, drink, and poison.

This Charm also confers the following techniques to the Solar: Conjure Image: For one mote, the Exalt can visualize an object she is touching, in sections no larger than a horse’s head. She can identify a familiar face in a pitch black crypt, but might need several activations to visualize the fossil skeleton of an ancient behemoth in a lightless cavern. Sense Current: For one mote, the Exalt can feel the lightest motion of air, orienting herself to the exit in even the most lightless of conditions. Read the Web: For five motes committed, the Exalt can listen in on a conversation behind a thick door, just by touching a connecting wall or surface. She feels the vibrations in her fingertips, and her senses translate them to words she can hear. This is a scene length effect, and its range can be extended up to [[ @{essence} * 100 ]](Essence x100) yards by running a wire from the Exalt’s fingertips into a chamber where her targets are speaking. Sound from Stillness Meditation: For six motes, one Willpower, the Solar can take a Simple action lasting five minutes to filter Creation, listening for specific sounds or conversations that have already happened. The Exalt draws audio from the vibrations of sounds stored in her surroundings —usually rocks and trees—and may listen for noises or conversations that happened up to [[ @{essence} * 5 ]](Essence x5) hours prior to her arrival with a difficulty 5 Awareness roll. For the duration of the technique, the Solar must remain still, listening intently as she filters out the garbled static and unwanted sounds to reach the reverberations she’s search- ing for.

If the damage roll generates at least one success, the target is knocked prone by the force of the blow, and loses a point of Initiative, which is added to the Solar’s base value (typically 3) when her Initiative resets. This blow strikes with the force of a hurricane condensed into the Solar’s fist. The more damaging the blow, the more forcefully her opponent will be knocked away from her: For at least three successes, the opponent is lifted and bodily hurled into an object or surface within close range, hitting it with an impact equivalent to falling a short distance (see falling damage, p. 232), destroying any less-obdurate objects he collides with, such as wooden furniture. At four or more successes, the foe is knocked into an object at close range with tremendous force, or is sent sailing a remarkable distance by the force of the blow. If the former, the opponent hits a surface with force sufficient to leave cracks in a stone wall, impacting with a surface as if he had fallen from a medium distance. If the latter, the force of the blow throws him to short range with a short-distance falling impact. At five or more successes, the foe is thrown to short range and suffers an impact like falling from a medium height. The Solar can use Heaven Thunder Hammer to knock her opponent into a high ceiling, forcing him to contend with falling damage on the way down. She might also choose to smash him through a weak point in a nearby wall, causing him to suffer a collapse. She might aim to hurl her opponent into a spike protruding from a surface, turning the damage lethal, or knock her enemy from a rooftop, causing him to suffer a fall from a much greater distance. The player should include the environment in their stunts to enhance this Charm’s effectiveness. At Essence 3+, double the successes for determining the distance the victim is hurled. At 7+, the victim can be hurled to medium range with a medium height impact.",

Heaven Thunder Hammer: The Solar must knock her foe to short or medium range on the attack in order to use this Charm. Doing so allows her to flash in to range before he impacts, cancelling his impact with scenery to strike him again.

The Exalt’s form is suffused with burning Solar Essence that fires straight up in a column that can be seen for miles. This is a non-standard decisive attack; roll the Solar’s Dexterity + Brawl once and apply the result to the entire group. This attack can hit allies. Targets struck by this attack are carried upward on a column of destructive force, one range band for every ten Initiative the Solar possesses. For every range band the targets are lifted, they are subject to three dice of hardness-ignoring decisive bashing damage and must then contend with falling damage. This portion of the attack does not reset the Solar’s Initiative. The Solar is also carried up to the same height as her enemies, but at the apex she pauses, Essence and anima swirling around her like a second sun. Then she plummets at an angle in any chosen direction, falling half the range bands she rose (rounded up). There she comes down like a falling star, hammering a crater into the earth and striking all opponents at close range with her explosive fury. This is a normal decisive attack that, if successful, does half her Initiative (rounded up) in hardness -ignoring decisive damage dice to all opponents at close range. This calamitous falling strike does no harm to the Solar.

However, she could not use this Charm to convince two enemies who have become lovers to remember their hate for one another.

This code of honor must be reflected in the writing of the charter, and the charter itself must be made available to every member the Solar wishes to effect with this Charm. Members who read the charter, or have had it read to them by a superior, become aware of the imbued Intimacies and can choose to act as the Solar would, taking advantage of those Intimacies as if they possessed them. Such a member can, for example, cite the Solar’s Intimacy in a decision point when someone is trying to promote corruption in the ranks of the Exalt’s subordinates. The effects of this Charm last until the Solar alters the charter, and may even continue beyond her death. On Honor-Instilling Mantra The backer wanted a Bureaucracy Charm that would allow him to instill the organization’s members such that they would always act as the Solar would. I felt that was way too powerful. Mind-controlling hundreds of people with a single Charm defeats the purpose of social influence. Instead we came up with a Charm that allows members of an organization to consult the Solar’s vision of honor and leadership, creating a communal well of ethical and moral action to draw strength from. No one under the effect of this Charm is forced to abide by it, but there are undeniable benefits for those who do. Couple that with the power of the prerequisite and the Solar gains a very sharp understanding of what goes on in her offices while she is not there. Special thanks goes to Holden for the core mechanic of this Charm. Backer: J Walker",

When activating the Charm, the Solar must be very specific about which kind of customers she will attract based on their Resources rating. The player can specify customers with “financial problems and Resources 5”, “multiple Resources 5 who need to deposit vast sums of money”, “a valuation inquiry and any Resources rating”, and so on. As long as the Solar’s net isn’t cast extremely wide, as soon as a person with the designated problem steps into the area affected by her Essence they will be drawn to her. Note that an arriving customer won’t exactly understand why they’ve been drawn to the Solar or how it was done. It’s up to the Solar to recognize the customer, figure out what their problem is, and impress them with her expertise and preeminence in all things commercial. Special activation rules: If the Solar knows the Larceny Charm Seasoned Criminal Method, the player may use this Charm to specify targets with “Larceny problems difficulty 1-5” or of one specific difficulty. The player may also combine specifications: “a subject with Resources 5 that has a difficulty 5 Larceny problem.” On Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit The backer’s favorite Caste is Eclipse, and their favorite Ability is Bureaucracy, so I decided to make them a very mystical, extremely useful Charm for Solars trying to operate in the shadow economy or who are simply trying to be very exclusive. Readers might be interested to know that the J.P. Morgan banking dynasty began with banking services catering only to the ultra rich, usually exclusively to trade organizations. They never advertised, and never opened up more than a single office in one country, and that exclusivity elevated them to a nigh-mythic stature. A Solar dealing in gigantic sums of capital, troubleshooting economic problems and providing legal services can become an even greater subject of myth, and even more sought after. This Charm also helps the Solar to protect herself, since direct advertisement or street-side storefronts aren’t always safe. Players should note that this Charm is bound to be more effective in busy trade districts of bustling cities. If you use this Charm in the dusty village of some half-dry desert watering hole, you might not have much luck attracting customers. Backer: Jordan Neal",

            "charm-effect": "In the moment the Exalt uses this Charm, an obscuring shadow slowly passes over her face. When it has passed, the coin between her fingers has become a coin of pure adamant, with the Unconquered Sun’s emblem on one side and the Solar’s sigil on the other. This coin has a number of properties and abilities. The Solar may give this coin to another, authorizing them to use it in the Solar’s name. Any ghost, god, or raksha who sees the coin will automatically recognize the bearer as a business agent of one of the Solar Exalted. Such beings gain automatic knowledge of the Solar’s full Resources rating, allowing the bearer to settle accounts and make purchases without an exchange of wealth. When the bearer makes such purchases on the Lawgiver’s behalf, the Adamant Specie represents a heavenly oath on the Solar’s behalf to pay the debt out of her standing Resources within a year and a day. If the target in this transaction is destroyed or makes it deliberately impossible for the Exalt to settle her account, the heavenly oath — but perhaps not the debt — is nullified. Mortal merchants have no power to recognize the accounts of the Solar Exalted at a glance, and Guildsmen are particularly well-trained in not accepting magicked coins. Demons, as participants in deliberately insurgent economies, recognize the Solar’s accounts but may always refuse to confer them credit. Ergo, neither demons nor Guildsmen honor such trade. Such a coin also has a number of other strange effects. For one, the bearer can travel through the bordermarches of the Wyld and as long as they are holding the coin, neither they nor the things they are wearing or carrying can be warped by the Wyld. The coin also evinces personal agency. If it is stolen, it can cause sudden cases of bad luck — 9s and 10s turned to 1s. To some it appears to give off a cursed silvery glow and they refuse to touch it. Others try to lift it and find that it is far beyond mortal strength to lift. In the open market, it has a way of getting mixed into local tender, riding commerce to the edges of the Solar’s reach. If taken up by someone who fits one of the specified criteria of Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit, the coin will lead that person to the Solar, even if they are at the far end of the city. Note that characters who are not authorized cannot use the coin to make purchases on the Solar’s account. Special activation rules: The Solar may only create one such coin per day, but may have up to [[@{essence}]](Essence) coins in circulation. She may at any time pay one mote reflexively to cause the magic to flee a coin, causing it to transform instantly into a dull lead coin with faded inscription. She may also will a coin back to herself, causing it to travel from person to person, riding transactions and turns of luck to make itself known to her so that she can reclaim it. This process usually takes five or six hours to complete. Less, if the Solar goes looking for it. If the Solar is slain, all of her adamant coins immediately lose their magic and turn to lead. On Creation of Adamant Specie A very strange and interesting Charm, particularly apt as it sits inside the Eclipse wheelhouse. This Charm also demonstrates how Solar Charms sometimes get a little inventive and outside-the-box at higher Essence, something I was hard-pressed to show while writing the framework of the design. The reason ghosts are an applicable target for this Charm is because ghosts are often fettered to the living world, and concerned with trade and transaction. Gods, as natural bureaucrats, also quite often find it very natural to wheel and deal. Both types of spirits adore worship, and so the loftier ideal of “credit” is something they can easily and very naturally grasp and work with. Demons are excluded from this triad for a number of reasons, from insurgent economy to slave caveat. What it boils down to is that a Yozi wants a Solar to conduct her business in person. The Lords of Chaos are however included because their existence is so often defined by relational trade with Creation. Raksha are simply “in the know” when it comes to doing business with their Solar enemies, and Solar magic accounts for them. And for those who are wondering, magical materials do not count as natural metals.",

This delivery comes to Creation through a spirit court, a raksha court, or from the court of the ancestors, and what is inside will be strange, ethereal, or morbid as matches its source. In any case, the package is wrapped in glorious, scintillating, luminously textured paper, but is magically bound by a ribbon and can be opened by none other than the Solar. The package draws fascinated crowds and it is automatically perceived as something wondrous, a gift from the gods, or something strange and exciting. Roll the Solar’s unmodified Intelligence + Bureaucracy against a difficulty of 2 to determine the package’s Resources value. The Solar does not know what is in the box before she opens it, but she does know its exact value the moment it is delivered, and may trade on the expectation of what might be inside. Through repeated use of this Charm, and the eventual delivery of goods which are nigh priceless, the Solar can drive up speculation on the mysterious delivery and, on the fiction of never knowing the value of what’s inside, she can sell away something utterly worthless for a fortune, and can keep something priceless for herself, or use high Resources packages to entice future prospects into bigger gambling, business partnerships, and so on.

As the Solar works with the remains of a broken or destroyed object, she may slowly piece it together with word, touch, and Essence over the course of [[ 10 - @{essence} ]](10 - Essence) hours. If used while under the effect of Craftsman Needs No Tools, this time is reduced to minutes or seconds, and eliminates both the need for tools and in many cases for materials. This Charm can restore magical objects but not metaphorical concepts: it cannot mend a broken heart, nor can it put the magic back into a First Age construct whose magic has fled or faded away. This Charm may lower the difficulty of repairing Artifacts that are fragmented or shattered, while also making such a repair possible, but otherwise does not remove the material requirements or affect the goal number.",

            "charm-effect": "A Solar with this Charm may retroactively complete a major project she never officially began in order to even the odds against a threat, dangerous obstacle, or critical conflict that has arisen. Upon using the Charm, the Solar’s player describes a retroactive continuity in which their Solar planned and built — or in some cases destroyed — the thing for just such an occasion. The sole limitation is that this plot device cannot simply resolve the conflict on its own. It can only be something that helps to make an unfair situation less inequitable. Special activation rules: The Solar must have at least 15+ silver points on hand to use this Charm. However, using this Charm requires no expenditure of craft experience . The finished project must reflect the Exalt’s chosen Craft Ability as well; a Solar with no skill as a seamstress cannot produce a ballgown to help an urchin look like a princess, nor can a Solar with no engineering skill reveal the location of a secret earthwork and palisade she built as a fallback position against the advancing Wyld Hunt. This Charm may only be used [[ ceil(@{essence}/2) ]](Essence / 2 round up) times per story. Lastly, if the player shows ingenuity or cleverness in their Solar’s invention, award them one silver and two gold points. If they devise something very witty, funny, or interesting — especially if it helps drive conflict — grant the Solar three gold and one white point. On Ever-Ready Innovation Discipline The backer requested a Charm for his Twilight mastermind , that would allow him to build a contingency plan through a flashback retcon. I decided to put it in Craft to help players insert a fresh opportunity to describe their character’s crafting efforts over time in a moment relevant to the scene at hand, essentially allowing them to bring their craftsmanship center stage. I stipulated that their labor couldn’t completely resolve the conflict because it made it easier to appreciate an act of Deus ex Anathema if the other players were allowed to get in on the action, as with a Solar who presents the Night Caste with a rickety hang-glider built from coastal ship-wreckage when she needs over the walls of Ostagul without actually touching them. Or the Solar who has revealed she’s dismantled three of the nine ballistae being wheeled up to the city gates — snapping her fingers and causing them to fall apart completely — so that the Dawn Caste can hold off the rest. Storytellers, if you feel like the plot device the player describes would resolve the conflict, feel free to reduce, alter, or damage it in some way to bring the conflict back into question. In addition, if you feel like there was absolutely no behind-the-scenes opportunity for the Exalt to finish the project they are describing, you can veto a use of this Charm. However, try to avoid doing this; if you can fathom the Exalt working into the wee hours working on her craft between all the other events in your story, allow it! Players need every opportunity to bring the long term (and therefore background) fruits of their labors into live, ongoing scenes. Examples in play:\n • As the Eclipse returns to port in her trireme, she is set upon by a number of enemy ships which lay ambush to her in the bay. As her Circle contemplates its options, the Twilight reveals a small ship — swift, sleek, and able — that will carry them to their comrade’s side.\n • An earthquake causes damage to thousands of expensive wheels of cheese, which will go bad if they are not used immediately, causing the economic collapse of an entire industry. The Solar chef produces a recipe for cheese soup that allows restaurateurs to buy the damaged wheels in increased volume, to attempt to save the industry from total collapse. See Projects on page 226 of Exalted.\n • A Lunar warlord-queen is sweet on the Dawn Caste, but if he makes an ass of himself at her feast the entire Circle is going to be kicked out of her dominion, and they badly need to remain there until their work is finished. Rather than trusting him to dress himself, the Zenith tailor presents a highly-stylized garment fit for royalty, so that the Circle’s fashion victim doesn’t get them exiled.\n • “What can be done about the Ten Thousand Wooden Soldiers of Andus Gouch? These thousand fire arrows I batched up are a start. Now let’s hope the winds are in our favor.” Backer: Meridian",

This Charm can also be used to shield the Solar against other environmental effects which would warp her mind or body, such as the twisting choral of the demon prince with voice like crystal facets, or the tainted Essence emanating from the intestines of a malfunctioning First Age manse. But be warned: once the Lawgiver is addicted to the Wyld or mutated by twisting energies, this Charm will not discontinue such effects; it will only prevent her condition from worsening. While Integrity-Protecting Prana protects the Solar and her possessions from being subject to environmental twisting powers, it does not allow her to ignore Wyld phenomena . She can still be torn apart by Wyld-spawned ravenous cyclones of burning teeth and giant hundred-armed mantises. This Charm also does not defend against attacks that might warp her mind or body directly, such as the Wyld-Mind Strike of the Thousand Venoms Mistress, or fiat-level changes to her existence caused by alterations to the Loom of Fate.",

Second, no matter how fatal or permanent the effect may be, fate itself will generate a condition by which the Solar may shatter any curse. This condition is decided by the Storyteller.

The Solar is not guaranteed to know the shattering condition of her curse, but characters with appropriate Lore, Medicine, and Occult Charms may be able to aid her in this regard. This Charm may be repurchased for every ten different Charms the Solar knows, amplifying its effects. This Charm is also stackable; a Solar who purchases it off the back of ten Melee Charms may purchase it again by using ten different Melee Charms. In this instance, the Storyteller should further lessen any changes wrought to the Solar.

Special activation rules: The Solar may pay six motes, one Willpower at the end of an hour to allow her followers to continue on with the method she has established even after she has gone. Doing so grants no more than two automatic successes against resisting disease or the elements , but provides the Charm’s full resistance against the Wyld or similar disfiguring hazards.",

However, the Exalt may only take Charms from spirits whose nature match one of her Defining Principles, and may only take one spirit Charm for every six Solar Ability Charms she knows which match both the spirit’s nature and the Defining Principle in question. Thus, the more strongly she embodies a certain Principle, the more Charms she can take from the god in question. The Storyteller can pick from published spirits or can make up appropriate Charms on the spot for the purposes of this Charm. The Exalt may take up the Charms of multiple different spirits simultaneously , but she may have no more than ten spirit Charms through Divine Mantle. However, if the grounding Principle is lowered in intensity or destroyed, or if any being successfully impugns her embodiment of said Principle by usurping her authority, defeating her, or destroying or harming the subject of her Principle, then she loses her ability to perform the greater miracles of the spirit’s office until she has taken actions to undo the harm or restore her damaged Principle. If the Solar wishes to change which spirit Charms she is using, she must spend one hour per Charm meditating on the target Principle. This allows her to move up or down the spirit’s Charm trees as needed. She can also swap [[ {@{essence},3}kh1 ]](Essence or three, whichever is greater) Charms through one use of Mind-Cleansing Prana. Adding the Charms of a new spirit to her repertoire requires a new activation of the Charm.",

            "charm-effect": "The Solar might grow to consider her allies to be an extension of her self. With a touch, the Lawgiver may use Empathic Aegis Discipline to deepen this connection. If the Solar has a Major or Defining Tie for a character who shares one of her Defining Principles, when the subject feels physical or emotional agony the Solar senses it and understands the context of their suffering. This is not a debilitating experience — a subject losing a hand does not have the same impact on the Solar. But she does understand that he’s been caught thieving and is being punished. If the subject is somewhere the Lawgiver has been, this Charm makes her aware of the subject’s whereabouts. If not, she gets a general sense of direction and [[ {@{essence},3}kh1 ]](greater of Essence or three) non-Charm successes to Awareness, Investigation, or Survival to find them. At Essence 4+, the cost of this Charm drops to three motes. Special activation rules: As long as the Solar has committed this Charm to at least one character, it automatically applies to every character that is bound to her through a magically powerful oath such as one produced through sorcery or the Eclipse anima power. On Empathic Aegis Discipline The backer asked for a Charm that would let him sense when his closest allies were in peril. For those of you who are wondering which Ability to use in order to find someone with this Charm, think of Awareness, Investigation, and Survival in terms of distances. If your friend has been tied, weighted, and thrown into a canal running through a busy city, you might be close enough — say, inside a nearby building — that upon emerging, you use Awareness Charms to hear their heartbeat at the bottom of the river, applying this Charm’s bonus to your attempt. But say they’re across the city, in a warehouse you’ve never seen, and someone is torturing them to reveal a secret. In that case, you would want to use Investigation Charms to try to find evidence of the abduction. But over a much larger distance, like a vast woodland, you would use Survival to track someone. Note that Awareness based Solar Charms are always helpful in noticing clues with Investigation or using Survival to see the minutest traces of a presence that has disturbed a natural environment.

            "charm-effect": "The Lawgiver wears her scars like armor. In a decision point she may cite something precious that she lost in defense of a Principle she still holds. Perhaps she lost an eye or a limb, or had to let go of someone she loved in order to pursue the path she’s now on. In doing so, she can resolve the decision point without paying a point of Willpower, and without tapping a relevant Intimacy (if any even exist). This Charm can only be used once per story, but can be reset by successfully resisting influence regarding the defended Principle twice more. On Strength from Conviction Stance The backer wanted something weighty and emotionally charged — a Charm to help demonstrate the strength and courage of a tremendously dedicated individual who has endured suffering in the pursuit of their cause. This Charm is uncanny, because at a glance it appears simple, but it is a little more complicated than it seems, yet at the same time it’s very easy to grasp when looking backward from the social influence system. If you’re a little fuzzy on decision points, this Charm functions by modifying the rule on Exalted page 221, third paragraph under the “Overturning Influence” header, about overturning influence by citing what has come before. Only it expands the definition of what you are allowed to cite, and doesn’t require an Intimacy. (You might have lost a Tie when a loved one died, but did you have an Intimacy for your lost eye? Probably not.) It also doesn’t require that you be under the effect of an ongoing persuade action; it simply treats your Principle as if it has the weight of a legendary quest. It’s also recursive; by waiving your need to tap an Intimacy, you can cite the very same reasons the next time you fall into a decision point. You’ll have to pay the Willpower and come up with a new Intimacy if you fall into a third decision point, but I feel the second repetition helps it feel like the Solar’s Conviction is profound.

The Lawgiver may use Judge’s Ear Technique to evaluate any statements heard by the witness during this psychic vision, and she may use the Investigation Excellency to amplify her roll, but she may not use any Simple-type Charms or Charms which would require her to handle evidence in order to fill out the witness’s testimony. On Truth-Rendering Attitude The backer wanted me to create a Charm for his Solar “Gavin of Nighthammer,” that would allow him to make a remote investigation through the eyes of a familiar or a subordinate. I decided to go with an approach that allows you to finish an action started by another, to model a great detective who can hear someone’s analysis of a crime scene and solve it instantly, or who can take their incomplete read on a particularly inscrutable or mysterious person, and give a full composite of that person and their most probable identity. Note that if someone tries to describe an event they did not witness, this Charm simply reveals nothing to the Solar. She should probably use the prerequisite to evaluate what she’s hearing. Also I decided to make it Mute to offset the weighty price. Backer: Ryan “Galby” Galbraith",

The distinctions are as follows:\n\n Familiarity:\n To a member of a criminal organization, she seems familiar—that is, she can play on a Minor Intimacy to make her target believe she is a criminal with whom to be treated: a member of the organization, a prospect for initiation, etc.\n\n Dissonance:\n Magistrates or other officials seeking to establish her identity suffer a -2 penalty to their Bureaucracy and Investigation actions. Persons who do not know her personally but may have spotted her or seen her hanging around the scene of a crime find her unrecognizable and cannot remember doing so.\n\n Vulnerability:\n The Exalt makes herself seem the best possible target for a type of crime dictated by the player. Confidence men will see her as an easy mark, gamblers will seek to engage her with betting gossip or games of chance, thugs will try to mug her, and so forth.\n This effect has a visual component: thieves are less likely to steal from an Exalt wearing armor and a battle axe, while a serial killer might find a person who wears her hair a certain way irresistible.\n\n Receptivity:\n Similar to vulnerability, interested parties perceive the Exalt as a local player. Rather than prey on her directly, she may be identified as a drug buyer or seller, or a person looking to make a bet, hire a prostitute, or take part in other illicit or seedy activities. Such parties will be interested in providing her with information about where to go and who to talk to.",

For a moment, the gloves suffuse her hands and blaze. For the next thirty seconds or two rounds, whichever comes first, no member of a criminal organization nor creature of darkness may Join Battle against the Lawgiver or roll to attack her. During this time, each of her allies gains +3 automatic successes to any attempt to escape the scene. After this effect ends, her hands continue to blaze. She may mute the effect with just a thought: her Null Anima Gloves fade to invisibility. They are still there, however. Should she use her hands to block an attack, land a strike, or steal an object, they will flash and hum back into existence , and remain that way until she banishes them. This is merely a visual display, however… Null Anima Gloves convey the following powers:\n • Raiton’s Unerring Claw: Once per full anima progression , she may reroll any Larceny-based action involving her hands.\n • Flashing Whip, Silent Whip: Once per day, she may use a free full Larceny Excellency to enhance an attempt to pickpocket or steal from plain sight.\n • Seize the Day: In combat, she may use a gambit which costs three Initiative to make a (Dexterity + Larceny) based decisive attack against her opponent, with double successes on the Initiative roll. If she succeeds, she regains four Initiative and steals an additional amount from the opponent equal to her Dexterity, adding it to her own total. The Exalt must be close enough to touch her opponent to use this technique and must use her hands to make the attack. Seize the Day can only be used once per battle, but is automatically reset when the Solar climbs to 15+ Initiative after landing a decisive attack which returns her to base Initiative.\n • Dream-Ending Gesture: With a curt flash of her hand, the Solar rips away the proof of her foe’s divinity. The Exalt uses a gambit costing five Initiative, making a (Dexterity + Larceny) based decisive attack against her opponent , with double successes on the Initiative roll. If the Exalt’s gambit succeeds, she steals a number of motes equal to her extra successes on the attack, adding them to her peripheral or personal motes. Dream-Ending Gesture can only be used once per scene.\n • Steal Inertia: Once per battle the Exalt may reflexively enact a (Dexterity + Larceny) Clash against an attack. This Clash is enhanced by [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic successes . If her successes cancel her opponent’s, she can be seen to stop the blow with her blazing, anima-suffused hands, and may automatically respond with a disarm gambit at no cost, using extra successes on the Clash as automatic successes to her gambit’s Initiative roll.\n • Hand-Spear Convocation: Upon stealing an artifact, she experiences a rush of power that surges through her body and floods into her hands, supplying the motes needed to attune the artifact, effectively reducing the cost of attunement to 0. This may only happen once per scene.",

She might notice an unlocked window or door, a guard who leaves his post at a certain time every night, a secret entrance, a pattern in security patrols, and so on. She can complete [[@{essence}]](Essence) weeks of observation in (difficulty x 10) minutes; flows of Essence show her snarls in the order of day to day operations, such that she can know a daily pattern after only having been present for just minutes. Roll the Solar’s Perception + Larceny with a difficulty based on the size and tightness of security, with an undefended shop rating difficulty 1, a merchant prince’s mansion rating difficulty 3, and the Imperial Treasury rating difficulty 6. The difficulty of this roll can be lowered with appropriately stunted Awareness Charms. If successful, the Lawgiver can introduce one fact about a weakness in the location’s security, and for every additional two successes she may name another factual security weakness, place of concealment, or other means of gaining surreptitious access to a place. Unlike introducing a fact with Lore, if the Solar beats the set difficulty, the Storyteller should always allow whatever fact the player introduces. If the Storyteller deems there are absolutely no flaws, the difficulty should be set to 10 and if the Solar jumps this hurdle then they still find at least one flaw. Special activation rules: By spending six points accrued by Master Plan Meditation, this Charm may be used retroactively, without a roll and for free, allowing the Solar to declare away a guard that’s just caught her, a trap that’s just sprung on her, a hiding place that wasn’t there before, and so on. She may only introduce a single fact in this fashion. On Sun-Stealing Shadow Spirit I badly wanted to do a Charm that would allow the Solar to effectively case a location using Larceny, but my initial try at it way back in 2013 was unworkable. Conversely, I came up with this mechanic as an afterthought while putting in bonus Charms. Oh the changes wrought by time and experience.",

However, upon success, the target will feel overwhelmingly compelled to act in a way that is the opposite of what she agreed to, as if her Intimacy had been inverted. For example, a Solar convinces an Immaculate priest of the evils of the har- lotry in Great Forks, convincing her to shun the temple prostitutes. The priest agrees vehemently, and then goes to live with them. Likewise, a Solar forced to brainwash a Circle member could outwardly torture him, while actually strengthening his Intimacies of love for her and his understanding of why his suffering is necessary. Once successful, persuasion caused by this Charm can’t be resisted with Willpower until another character successfully dissuades the target from a chosen course of action (p. 221), and upon doing so, the target must pay [[@{essence}]](Solar’s Essence) Willpower to break free. Intimacies tainted by this Charm are more insidious— they are both harder to root out, but also indecipherable from what a character truly believes. While Transcendent Hero’s Meditation (p. 308) can shatter persuasion caused by this Charm, it can’t change the Solar’s Intimacies, though it does make her realize how she’s been influenced.",

This Charm supplements an extended roll to produce such work (see p. 221), automatically reducing the interval by one unit, from years to seasons, seasons to months, and months to weeks. While this Charm greatly speeds the Solar’s efforts, it does not directly influence the mechanical speed with which she lays down words—her speed is increased by a streamlining of thought processes and an amplification of the mental faculties that surround vocabulary and dissemination skills, rather than an increase of manual dexterity. The Exalt must use this Charm against each interval she wishes to shorten, and must be able to dedicate the required time and writing instruments to the task.

A repurchase at Essence 4+ allows the Exalt to pay twelve motes, one Willpower, to reduce an interval by two units. Reducing the work of years to months, or seasons to weeks is a challenging feat if the Solar does all the work mentally ; if she is physically writing, she may need Whirling Brush Method to keep up with the speed at which she can process ideas. The Lawgiver may not yet reduce production time of a tome to less than a unit of weeks. A second repurchase at Essence 5+ allows the Exalt to pay fifteen motes, one Willpower, to reduce an interval by a full three units of time.

It gives her no control over them whatsoever, only a chance to compel them to her purposes. It may also come to pass that no character in range perfectly matches the Solar’s bequest.

This creates a message no longer than two breaths in spoken length, and lays it over a space up to (Essence x 3) yards wide or (x 5) high. This message appears in the runes, pictograms , or letters of the language the Exalt is speaking. If she wishes to infuse this message with Written-only Linguistics magic, she may pay to do so at this time, treating Simple-type Linguistic Charms as if they were Reflexive. The Solar must be within fifty yards of the surface she is speaking words onto. Anyone who reads this message is subject to any social influence entailed in the script — usually modeled as a typical contest of Linguistics vs. Resolve — but only the first time they read it. As long as the Solar keeps motes committed to this effect, the script cannot be scrubbed from the surface of the wall, and any attempt to write over it fails. If the script it painted over, it bleeds through. Any attempt to otherwise cover it ends in horrific botches. The only way to remove the Lawgiver’s words are to kill her, destroy the surface her words are written on, or use a special sorcerous working (Terrestrial Circle, Ambition 2, Finesse 1, Terminus 3). This sorcerous working costs no experience points, but requires one point of temporary Willpower on each one week interval. Failing to reach the goal by the terminus makes this effect immune to any sorcerous tampering by any sorcerer for two weeks. This failure can be noticed by a character using All-Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight (Exalted p. 356) or similar magic. By paying one Willpower when activating this Charm, the Lawgiver raises the difficulty of removing her words with a sorcerous working to (Terrestrial Circle, Ambition 2, Finesse 3, Terminus 1) and can choose to gouge her words into a surface as hard as granite. On Indelible Spoken Script When I note that the failure can be noticed with All- Encompassing Sorcerer’s Sight, I am not only referring to the temporary invincibility of the effect, but also the sorcerer who failed the working. A sorcerer who looks into the world of Essence will see the failed sorcerer emblazoned with the Solar’s message.",

            "charm-effect": "Affirming Blow, Truth-Rendering Gaze Of all the Chosen, the Solar Exalted alone have the power to stem the tides of chaos with their force of will. This Charm represents a Solar whose mind flows with a command of knowledge so potent it can reverse the decay of Creation. Channeling endless lore through unsurpassed Essence, the Solar stands at the edge of the world and forces shape into the howling teeth of the storm. System: Through use of this Charm, the Solar can fashion the raw forces of chaos into practically anything—so long as her mind is able to conceptualize the reality of her desire and force it to take shape. This Charm occurs in and depends on phases to accomplish such a feat. Wyld-Shaping Technique consists of a dramatic action lasting about a minute, in which the Solar forces her will upon the Wyld, pays the cost of the Charm, and makes an (Intelligence + Lore) roll against a specified difficulty. Each time she succeeds at this roll, a phase is completed. Some things can be shaped in a single phase. Others require that the Solar continue to use Wyld-Shaping Technique, phase after phase, in order to reach an appropriate phase on which to accomplish her goal. Each time she reaches a new phase and repays the cost of the Charm, her results from the previous phase are dissolved and reshaped. Essentially, the Solar must shape and reshape the Wyld in order to create larger, more powerful, or more specific results. The base difficulty of using Wyld-Shaping Technique is 5. At each new phase, the difficulty increases by one. Therefore , at phase three the difficulty would be 7, and phase six would require overcoming a difficulty of 10. During each phase, the Solar must remain near the relative epicenter of her shaping action. She can defend and attack, and she can move in response to her own environmental shaping, but she cannot engage in other extended actions such as sorcery. If she is incapacitated or fails the difficulty roll, the consequences are severe. She loses the cost of her Charm, including any invested experience points, and the shaping action fails completely. Moreover, she will experience a backlash if she botches, provoking an immune response from the Wyld—whatever she was trying to shape will turn against her and try to strike her down. The higher the phase at which this occurs, the more powerful the Wyld’s response will be. Considerations: In order to activate this Charm, the Solar must be standing at the absolute border of the middlemarches , facing the deep Wyld, or must otherwise be within the deep Wyld itself. Wyld-Shaping Technique requires the pure, inchoate resonance of chaos to work; the bordermarches and middlemarches of Creation are too solid to shape. Therefore, the more complex or large a thing the Solar wishes to shape, the deeper into the deep Wyld she needs to go. It would suffice for her to shape a gold ingot at Creation’s rim, but to raise an island of Creation from the Wyld, she would need to travel several miles into chaos. Use of Wyld-Shaping Technique automatically ends use of Chaos-Repelling Pattern in every direction around the Solar for three range bands. While the Exalt is employing this Charm, the Wyld is suborned by her supernal will. As with Chaos-Repelling Pattern, her immediate atmosphere will remain stable, and will adhere to the laws of physics for the Charm’s duration. Unlike Chaos-Repelling Pattern, the Lawgiver can be affected by body- and soul-shaping magic while working this Charm, unless she is under the aegis of Charms such as Integrity-Protecting Prana or Wyld-Dispelling Prana. As with Chaos-Repelling Pattern, the Solar can still be attacked by Wyld-spawned denizens while using Wyld-Shaping Technique. In fact, use of this Charm almost certainly guarantees that she will be. Encounter Roll: At the start of each phase, after the Charm’s cost has been paid but before the player has made the Charm’s roll, there is an encounter roll to determine whether the Solar is challenged by denizens of the Wyld. Roll a single die and add the Solar’s Essence to the result to determine the outcome. At each subsequent phase, remove 1 from the roll result. 8+: No encounter. 7: A small group (3-5) of weak enemies such as hobgoblins or pumpkin -men attacks. 6: A more powerful Fair Folk appears with a number of weaker minions. 5: A raksha hunting party (3-5 members) with a number of hunting beasts and minions appear. 4: As 5, but the force is slightly larger and led by a raksha noble. Alternately, a powerful Wyldspawned monster appears. 3: A number of powerful Fair Folk (hannya, noble raksha or otherwise) or other Wyld denizens emerge. Alternately, multiple Wyld-spawned monsters emerge. 2: The Solar is swarmed by hundreds of weaker Fair Folk or other Wyld denizens, joined by a number of powerful fae creatures; alternately, a dozen monsters are shaped by the Wyld to go on the attack. 1-0: A behemoth stirs from its slumber to attack the Solar. Phases: The Solar must reach a certain phase of Wyld- Shaping Technique in order to raise substance from chaos. For example, if a shaping project must be completed on phase two, the phase is successfully completed after the Exalt succeeds at the Charm’s roll. Land: The Solar can create non-specific land much more easily than she can raise very specific tracts. It is much easier for her to call forth massive amounts of general land than it is for her to induct very specific geography, and smaller, more specific geography is much more difficult than larger masses of land simply exuded from her formidable unconscious. For non-specific land, she can create (Essence x10) square miles of land in the first phase, and every successive phase multiplies this by three until phase eight. From phase eight and onward, each successive phase adds (Essence x1000) square miles. Additionally, the Solar can spend extra successes in each phase to add ten square miles to the land’s area at a rate of two successes per ten square miles. After phase seven, the cost decreases to one success per one hundred square miles. With non-specific land, the climate, geography, wildlife, spirits, and sentient beings that exist there will correlate with the nearest Pole. Until phase three, no demesnes are guaranteed to form, though previously generated land can still be geomantically sculpted to produce demesnes. After phase three, non-specific land will generate at least one additional minor demesne each phase, and any non-specific land created at phase six or beyond is guaranteed to have a number of major and minor demesnes. The Solar may spend three successes in any phase to roll a single die; success guarantee a demesne forms, with 7s and 8s equaling a minor demesne of appropriate aspect, 9s equaling a major demesne of appropriate aspect, and a 10 equaling a major demesne with an aspect specified by the Solar. The Solar may not add more demesnes to a created landmass than she has spent on upgrades to its area (ie, she must spend two extra successes on increasing land size in order to add an extra demesne). The larger a landmass the Solar is able to create, the more natural resources it will have. The more demesnes it has, the greater the chance it will contain veins of the five magical materials. The Lawgiver may not begin to create very specific land until phase four; she must first generate three phases of non-specific land in order to generate specific land, at which point she starts completely over, losing all generated land, creatures, and demesnes, generating [[ @{essence} * 5 ]](Essence x5) square miles in the first phase, and multiplying the preceding area by five in each successive phase until phase seven. In phase seven the area increases as above, at a rate of [[ @{essence} * 1000 ]](Essence x1000) square miles per phase. Increasing square miles in this calculation costs three successes per ten square miles, and the cost of demesne generation is four successes per demesne. With specific land, the Solar can designate the kind of terrain, resources or lack of them, the kind of climate and the kind of denizens. The Solar may specify the aspect of all minor demesnes created by rolls or those that naturally occur at later phases. At phase six, she can designate the kinds of sentient creatures living in her world, and such creatures will have both positive and negative Intimacies toward her. She has no control over the spirits inducted into her reality, but each that intrudes on her domain at this phase or beyond will automatically have an Intimacy centered on her of the Storyteller’s choosing. Legendary Demesne: Without Charms specifically dedicated to the creation of legendary demesnes, a Solar must succeed at a phase seven or higher roll for specific land to create a legendary demesne, and she must have at least five major, roll-generated demesnes to do so. If successful , she loses all of her roll-generated demesnes and all minor demesnes, and half her land’s area, to shape a legendary demesne. She may then start building land mass again at phase one, using the above rules. Mundane Wealth: Creating wealth is a process similar to creating land. Each resources value increase requires that the Solar reach a certain phase by synthesizing appropriate precursor materials. For example, a silver dirham (worth a bit over Resources 2) is required in order to make five silver talents (Resources 3). At phase one, the Solar can make wealth in excess of Resources 2. Examples of such wealth include a silver dirham, a single well-cut diamond, or half a dozen gold ingots. Extra successes can be used to personalize or specialize such material wealth, giving exquisite, exotic shape and cut to a single diamond or fashioning a number of ingots into jewelry at a rate of two successes per transformation. At phase two, Resources 3 mundane wealth can be created; at phase three, materials in excess of Resources 3 can be created; at phase four, Resources 4 wealth can be created, and at phase five, wealth in excess of Resources 4 but below Resources 5 can be created. A phase six transformation of materials is required to create Resources 5 wealth. Phases in excess of six do not greatly increase the wealth generated by Wyld-Shaping Technique. Five Magical Materials: In order to create an instance of one of the five magical materials, the Solar must create a minor demesne of the appropriate aspect using the rules above. She may then completely obliviate the land and attached demesnes in order to create enough ore to process it into a single mina in phase one. A phase two synthesis lets her turn the approximated magical material into a single bar of the same type of material; a phase three synthesis allows her to create as much as a talent, while a phase four synthesis allows her to create two talents, and so on. It takes approximately five talents of a magical material to build a grand daiklave. Artifacts and Manses: Artifacts, manses, and certain other wonders require special Charms in order to create with Wyld-Shaping Technique. Everything Else: Wyld-Shaping Technique works through a process of conceptual graduation. In order to raise a fortress, the Solar must first create land to stand it on. The Solar may create anything within the realm of possibility, her logic, or her know-how by following these basic rules. To create a mighty warship, she must raise a cradle to set it on in phase one, or otherwise must have created a body of water to float it in using specific land. The boat is then created in phase two. The deeper into the phases of specific land she goes, the more warships she is able to raise in a single phase, so long as she continues to grow the body of water with each successive phase. A Solar who spends the effort and experience points to create an ocean can also raise up an armada on its waters. The creation of land can be foregone in instances where the Solar can conceptualize some other base for beginning her project, such as the cradle for a ship, but the most powerful expressions of Wyld-Shaping Technique work by way of graduating from one concept to the next. It is much easier to create a number of warships by first creating the waters they sail upon. This process is reversed in order to build even more insane constructs. To raise up marvels such as golem manufactories , the Solar must catabolize something much more powerful, such as a legendary demesne.",

Her player may then make a pronouncement against an ongoing project based on knowledge her studies reveal, creating bonuses for those who act in accordance with her accurate predictions, and penalties for those who go against them. For example, after reading about the patterns of weather, hostile elemental activity and famine in Jiara during the summer months over the last thousand years, she predicts that Mnemon will not attack Jiaran rebels until fall at the earliest, and will instead spend the summer months consolidating her forces while conserving water and gathering resources for a winter campaign. If Mnemon enacts a project to consolidate her forces while gathering resources until winter, the Storyteller should consider Mnemon ’s project vastly more successful and easier to complete than otherwise. If Mnemon instead decides to invade Jiaran rebel territory in the summer, her invasion will be met with project difficulties, such as resource shortages, elemental attacks, inclement weather, and more specifically, mechanical penalties to the first War rolls her generals make in the conflict. Conversely, if Mnemon harbors her forces and the Jiaran rebels instead try to attack her, it is their commanders who will suffer penalties to their opening War rolls. Once the Solar has made a prediction, it may not be canceled with a conflicting use of this or similar Charms, though it may be counteracted with Sidereal Astrology or similar powerful fate-bending magic.

A basic success is tantamount to the Solar predicting a natural disaster that has relatively damning effects: flash floods ruin roads, a drought destroys crops, an earth- quake disables a vitally important manse, and so on. Two to four extra successes results in a more devastating cataclysm : a tsunami wipes out a fleet of battleships; a series of earthquakes devastate the infrastructures of several cities and roads; a volcano detonates and wipes a city entirely off the map, etc. Five or more extra successes equates to the Solar predicting one of the seven great dooms: a star falls and annihilates a region; a behemoth rises from its slumber and plows through a number of predicted cities; an army of the dead spills from its Shadowland during Calibration to wreak havoc, and so on. The Solar decides what region to research and pronounce doom upon, but the Storyteller decides the nature of the doom she divines based on the result of the roll. The Solar may show mercy by repudiating her pronouncement of devastation at any point before the cataclysm manifests itself, thereby negating her dread prophecy. Though this Charm’s duration is instant, the motes spent activating it are committed for one week if a pronouncement of doom is uttered and allowed to manifest. This Charm may only be used once per year, though it can be reset as often as once per season by paying 12 experience points.",

This Charm does not give the Solar knowledge she doesn’t have — it can’t turn a geologist into a student of ancient histories — but it does tell her where to begin her studies anew. On Hundred Sages Focus I came up with this Charm while preparing to run my own personal game of Exalted. As I was seeding the environment with deeply-seated lore and “unsolvable” mysteries, I started looking at the hidden histories of my game and deciding what it would take for our group’s Lore Solar to crack those mysteries wide open. In my game notes I started tagging environmental features thusly: “geological formation: geology difficulty 3”, “colossal arm of blue stone sticking out of the mountain: ‘biography of the Celestial Incarnae’ difficulty 10” and so on. In the former case, geology is the needed background or “Lore topic.” The latter refers to a book in a library in Yu-Shan, of which there is no other copy, and which has never been to Creation. Whenever I contemplate running an Exalted game, I always consider which Charms my players are using and which Abilities they are going to be rolling, and then I fill out the structure of every night’s gaming with a list of interesting Ability checks and opportunities to use said Charms. I seed the environment with difficult challenges . For my friend the investigator, I create mysteries and leave evidence. For the Solar savant, I fill the game with wondrous lore. For the occult specialist, strange and uncanny mysteries that are outside Lore’s purview. In essence, I build my personal games of Exalted around my players. This Charm is an outgrowth of that, allowing a player to mine the hidden secrets from the setting, to find the presents I have buried for the whole Circle to stare at — in wonder, in horror. One last thing: Harmonious Academic Methodology increases the gamut of your Solar’s knowledge. So if you find your Storyteller has placed a mystery in front of you that is outside your Solar’s background, hit the library, conduct interviews at the local academy, quiz a Sidereal, put a spirit in a headlock and make them teach you — whatever it takes to expand your Solar’s mind — and use that Charm whenever you can, so your Solar’s knowledge grows voluminously.",

Such a feat is usually impossible, but the Exalt may roll (Intelligence + Medicine) against difficulty 5 to heal such conditions. Regrowth of lost or missing tissues is a much more challenging affair, as is the repair of deformities, Wyld mutation or mental Derangements . However, the Solar’s prowess is such that of these, only Derangements cannot be fully cured. In each case, the Storyteller should decide if the wound, malady or defect is Minor, Major, or Defining. Defining would include paralysis, lost limbs, missing eyes, complete lunacy, and mutations that renders a person completely incapable of a normal human life. The Solar must dedicate four hours a month to treating such conditions through whatever medical means and stunts seem appropriate. This begins an extended roll with a goal of 20, an interval of one month and a difficulty of 5. Under wraps, earth compacts, and acupuncture , a Solar can rebuild the lost tissues of destroyed eyes and missing limbs, and can even aid a target in growing organs that he was born without. Each time the Solar succeeds at the goal number, the malady decreases in intensity . Once it the goal has been met at the Minor level, a condition vanishes. Missing limbs are fully regrown, paralysis victims are able to walk, mutations wither and slough away or become easily operable.

While Immortal Blade Triumphant is active, her weapon cannot be disarmed or destroyed, and when she makes attacks, her damage is boosted greatly. Any stunt bonuses to her attacks are also added to her damage rolls, and if she is at the bonfire anima level, [[@{essence}]](Essence) damage dice are converted into automatic successes. Should the Solar need even greater power than this, she may force her anima out through her blade, releasing the Essence committed and terminating this Charm in a single devastating decisive attack. Doing so adds [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic successes to the damage roll instead of converting [[@{essence}]](Essence) dice to automatic successes, and allows the attack to bypass hardness. This attack can only be made at the bonfire anima level. Calling upon this power ends this Charm and resets the Solar’s anima banner to the dim level.",

On Stark Truth of Steel Method The backer wanted a Melee Charm that would allow him to exploit a flaw in his opponent’s defense to land an attack. I felt that a Charm that magnified wound or onslaught penalties was a bit too divorced from an expression of Melee skill, so I went with this Charm, which would reveal a weakness or flaw in an opponent through a mystical insight.

Brandishing her Essence-laden weapon, when the Solar successfully parries a decisive attack of 17+ base damage, she may use this Charm to redirect the damage in a shockwave that cuts a circle of destruction around herself. This attack automatically damages or destroys any non-magical scenery in range, doing automatic damage equal to half the decisive attack (rounded down). Done in a temple, pillars will begin to slide off of their bases. Done in a forest, trees will begin to topple all around the Solar. This attack also automatically hits every trivial opponent in close range, and [[ {@{essence},3}kh1 ]](greater of Essence or three) dangerous opponents in close range. Roll decisive damage equal to half the attack’s Initiative (round down) against the dangerous opponents. Trivial opponents take automatic decisive damage equal to the dangerous opponent who takes the most damage plus three. This attack does not use the Solar’s Initiative and does not reset her to base Initiative. The Solar may use this Charm once per battle, but may reset it by raising her Initiative to 20+ and then landing a decisive attack, or by rolling Join Battle. If the Solar knows Sandstorm-Wind Attack, Whirlwind- Tempest Deflection can be increased to short range by paying three extra motes. On Whirlwind-Tempest Deflection The backer wanted a Charm that would allow him to block an attack and redirect a destructive shockwave around himself from parrying the force of the blow. A decidedly simple request that ended up being a fairly complicated Charm! I tried to make it as roll-free as possible while retaining its balance. Thus the limitation to how often you can use it and the similarly high cost. Backer: Scott Ryder",

Omniscient Focus Attack will work on concealed foes as well. For the most part, attacking from concealment reveals the attacker’s location, but if they are using magic to keep this from happening and yet the Solar does a lot of damage or kills them with her clash, the Storyteller should consider them revealed anyway, as the Solar slashes through a grate and blood pours from the place of concealment , or a dead body tumbles down out of a well of perfect shadows.",

When she first uses this Charm, she grips her weapon tightly and makes a vow based on a Principle or Tie that she holds, to use her every means to defend or protect that Intimacy. This act has great mystical significance, recorded in the celestial registers of Heaven, as the Lawgiver swears on her weapon and her skill to protect what is most dear. Thenceforth, whenever the Exalt makes a Melee attack in defense of the attached Intimacy and pays one mote, she gains bonus dice equal to (Intensity). In addition, if her target has acted to harm one of her Ties or threaten one of her Principles, a successful attack adds damage equal to the target’s strongest opposed Intimacy to the Solar or her protected Tie or Principle. In simple terms, the Lawgiver may not know her opponent’s Intimacies, but the Storyteller does, and can select the most appropriate Intimacy on the damage roll. If the Solar has vowed to protect the street urchins of Nighthammer, she may not realize that her target despises children, but the damage of her attack rips through his corrosive spirit and wounds him that much more deeply. This Charm confers no knowledge of Intimacies to the Solar. In addition, if the target is a cursed, blighted creature, such as a ghost or a demon, or one of the Abyssal Exalted, the damage on this attack is increased by one, gains one automatic success, and the damage is aggravated. On Divine Executioner Stance The backer wanted a Melee Charm that would give him some added whomp from drawing on his Intimacies for an attack. A critical read on this Charm reveals that Solar Essence rips through and obliterates beings that are antithetical to the Solar’s spirit, ideals, and personal character. Intimacies are important to the formulation of a character’s identity, and a character’s identity is the foundation of their Essence, their total being. Thus the Divine Executioner is poised to strike down those who stand against her and the things she represents. Backer: Patrick “Ash” Colford",

This Charm allows the Solar to induct a single spirit into the world. She draws this creature from her surroundings, but may also use the Essence-patterns of spirits she has captured with Burning Exorcism Technique or absorbed with Carnal Spirit Rending to determine the being’s nature and magic. The spirit begins the game with the Solar’s Essence rating and half her total experience, but may only use the most basic spirit Charms until the Storyteller has had sufficient time to approve the spirit’s stats, Intimacies, and magic, as determined by the Solar’s player. This spirit is bound to the Solar as a familiar and becomes an applicable target for certain Survival Charms. A spirit created by the Solar is her thrall for a season. She may then choose to keep it as her familiar or release it. Freeing the current familiar allows her to use this Charm again to create a new familiar . If she decides to retain a bond with the original creature , then she keeps it for another season. Each season that comes and goes, she may choose to retain or relinquish her bond with the spirit so that she may attain a new familiar. Otherwise, the spirit remains as her familiar and is in all senses another character, gaining experience points as any character would. Alternately, the Solar may also induct a Fair Folk into the world. In the Wyld, this Charm usually entails the creation of a raksha, but in Creation , where many denizens of the Wyld were bound into place by the elemental fusion of the Poles, the result is bound to be more unpredictable.",

As long as the Solar’s anima is visible, the familiar gains the imparted Charms automatically. If it drops a level the Charms it can use are likewise reduced.

On What Light Reveals (Living Specter’s Flame) The backer wanted a Charm that would power up their spirit familiar based on the intensity of their anima. I decided it would be an Occult Charm, because the uncanny nature of Occult Charms allows for strangeness in the method. This Charm demonstrates the nature of Essence to be the whole or sum of the being. Therefore, if a Solar is absorbing the Essence of spirits, her own Essence is affected.

Roll the Exalt’s ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) against the group’s Resolve, subtracting successes instead of dice (p. 188) for truly outrageous claims. Mere success entails a simple belief in the facts as the Solar has presented them. Extra successes, however, increase commitment to this belief. Affected characters gain a Resolve bonus equal to half the extra successes, rounded up, to defending their belief in the Solar’s narrative. Until that belief is shattered, they will act in direct agreement with the Solar’s version of events. In order to break his commitment, a character must present direct evidence to the contrary and defeat the character’s boosted Resolve. Failing to do so makes the character immune to further attempts to erode this belief for the rest of the day. Each time an unsuccessful attempt is made, the affected character’s bonus Resolve is diminished by two. Once the Solar has successfully changed a target’s memories, she may not make additional changes to that character’s mind with this Charm until the initial belief has been completely broken.

After the player has named the effect of the song, the Storyteller can decide how it affects the scene, adding or subtracting bonus dice equal to the Solar’s Essence. For example, a song with a calming influence will penalize social influence that attempts to provoke anger, while romantic music enhances sexual persuasion. This Charm enhances and penalizes the social influence of anyone who can hear it. The Solar’s music can also instead be tailored to enhance a dance or a song sung by a specific character.",

Any relevant Intimacies they have for “divine beings” or “spirits” or “holiness” automatically qualify as Resolve modifiers for the Solar’s music, regardless of what she intends by it. On Divine Instrument I deliberated for a long time about whether to include this in the effect in the core book. I even wrote it as a different Charm, but decided to cut it for space. This Charm is actually a much better version with a more interesting name and mechanic. For those who are interested, the Abyssal version is very similar, and has you drawing a musician’s bow across the Shroud, eliciting a screech as it passes over invisible strings into your hand. Then as you flourish and bow in introduction, your instrument appears in a gout of black flame. But don’t worry; if you don’t use a bow, plectrum, baton, et al, you’ll still be covered. Another kind of Exalt has their own version called Oud Flying Elsewhere; they hold their instrument high, let go, and it falls into the sky. When they need it back they reach up and it falls back down into their hand. Even in a completely enclosed space, it comes right down.",

When confronted with a natural environmental hazard such as a forest fire, a driving blizzard, a hurricane, and so on, the Solar may dispel nature’s fury with overriding music. Roll the Lawgiver’s Charisma + Performance with Essence automatic successes against the difficulty of the hazard. If successful, she creates a safe path for a group of followers (Essence + [one per two extra successes]) in Size. A raging inferno that covers a hundred miles will snuff out in a path large enough for her party to pass safely through, a river of magma becomes cool enough to cross barefoot, and a hurricane may be diverted narrowly from its course. The Solar’s music need only contend with elemental forces for a handful of seconds in order to dispel them, but this effect lasts [[ @{essence} * 30 ]](Essence x 30) minutes, despite the listed duration. Lastly, the effect is centered around the Solar, and if she is still in a state of danger from the environmental hazard when this Charm’s time is up, she becomes aware of her need to re-use the Charm at least five minutes in advance. In that case, waive the Willpower cost to reactivate the Charm. A repurchase of this Charm allows the Exalt to deal with supernatural environmental hazards and unusual hazards such as acid baths. She can turn a cauldron of boiling oil into a warm bath or ward off the demon winds of Malfeas. After a repurchase, at Essence 4+, the Solar can use this Charm to destroy a sorcerous working that is barring her in the pursuit of a Defining Intimacy, rolling Charisma or Manipulation + Performance against the Resolve of the sorcerer who placed it, even if they are dead. A success allows her to shatter a minor working, or undo a major working until she has safely passed through it. Such a working is typically never an environmental hazard. It might be a massive seam where two mountains were fused to seal a path, an immovable capstone over a cave of lost dreams, a mind-worm whose screams force your best friend to fight you to the death, and so on. On Seventeen Cycles Symphony The backer wanted a Charm that would allow him to play a Solar Orpheus, able to quell nature’s wrath. I liked the idea so much I decided to expand it to make it a real homage to the mythical hero, who would stop at nothing in his quest. Storytellers should allow some creative latitude in basic interpretation of this Charm. A bank of thick fog over a rocky bay might not count as an environmental hazard in the strictest terms, but you should let a Solar dispel the fog so her captain can steer a safer course. Her song can’t get rid of the rocks, but perhaps it can calm the tides. You also might note that using this to cut a swath through a blizzard won’t make it magically warm and sunny. It will just get rid of the worst, most dangerous and threatening conditions of the blizzard, allowing your group to pass. Backer: Nathan Henderson",

This Charm supplements a Performance roll when play-acting, adding one automatic success. In addition, this Charm mutes the [[ {@{essence},3}kh1 ]](highest of [Essence] or three) peripheral motes used on that tick, while taking any successes over the average audience member ’s Resolve (or Guile if applicable) and awarding them to the person acting opposite the Solar, to be used as non- Charm dice for their next Performance roll. Characters thus enhanced feed off the Solar’s energy, enhancing their own acting. The Solar’s fellow actors experience this not as an infusion of “good acting magic” but rather feel the Solar inhabits the soul of the character she is playing, reads the audience perfectly, and puts on a performance of such magnitude that they themselves are elevated. If such a character’s acting is particularly well received after critics review their performance, they will generate an appropriate Intimacy for the Solar, such as awed respect for her talent, or adoration for the Solar herself. Lastly, any 9s or 10s on the enhanced roll by the actor opposite the Solar restore an equal number of motes to the Solar. On Drama-Fueling Ardor Another case of not having enough room in the core book. I really wanted to explore the thespian arm of the Performance tree, but there was simply no room.

On Holy Touch This Charm can also be used socially if combat wouldn’t make sense — generally against characters the Storyteller wouldn’t have you Join Battle to defeat with a regular attack. In this case, the Solar can trigger the Charm without a gambit; roleplaying and social influence determines whether she makes the appropriate contact. I’d also like to note that a Solar who has the power of Holy Touch can gather her Essence, condensing her anima into a visible sphere in her palms. This has no cost or overt social influence, but characters who see it will certainly have some reaction to it.",

The Exalt may use this Charm once per round on her turn to make a sudden gesture or action that completely reverses a lesser miracle. Generally this works without a roll, but if the Storyteller deems it necessary, roll a clash between the Charisma + Presence of the two characters. Thus with a clap of her hands, the Solar can cause a withered flower to stand back up and bloom brightly. With a stomp of her foot she can cause a spring that dried out centuries ago to well up with fresh water. Altering a spirit’s dominion in this fashion automatically informs the spirit of the presence of one of the Solar Exalted. No other being could so casually gainsay a god. On God-Heeling Gesture This Charm cannot be used to counter the effects of magic that supplements or creates an attack. Use your noggin when adjudicating where and when to allow this Charm in play. If “winter thaw” cruelly kills a random sparrow, the Solar can make a mudra to restore the bird to life. If the Solar’s sparrow familiar is killed by a lightning bolt hurled by a god, nothing can restore it to life.",

The Exalt may only use this Charm on a character enhanced by the prerequisite. The enhanced character must also possess Charisma 3+ and Presence 3+ to receive this power. This Charm adds three motes to the prophet’s mote pool and grants them a Charm called Divine Aspect, a one mote reflexive Charm that grants them one automatic success to a Presence roll to social influence that is an accordance with one of the Solar’s Defining Principles. This Charm confers knowledge of a single such Intimacy; if the Intimacy is already known, this Charm confirms it as the Solar commands her prophet to go forth and be righteous and just according to her wishes. Divine Aspect may also be used to reflexively raise the prophet’s Resolve by one. Lastly, whenever the prophet uses Divine Aspect to rebuke or command one who has transgressed against the Solar, the Lawgiver senses it and may pay one mote, one Willpower to cause the prophet to blaze with her glory, lit up with Solar anima. Wreathed in flame, the prophet’s mien appears as the Solar’s, and the prophet speaks with the Solar’s voice, and the Solar may inhabit her prophet’s form, using them as a vessel for her own Presence and Integrity Charms for [[@{essence}]](Essence) rounds. The Solar can use her prophet’s senses and can control their gestures, but this does not confer the Solar sensory control necessary for Awareness or Investigation, or the ability to fight using her prophet’s body. The Solar pays the cost of any Presence or Integrity Charms used on her prophet’s behalf. On Voice-Empowering Aspect (Aspect-Imbued Voice) The backer requested a Charm that would allow a Solar to suffuse a follower with her sacred and divine presence so that they might go forth in the Solar’s name like a prophet of old and do battle with evil. He specifically mentioned the conferring of power from Elijah to Elisha and gave the sense that he wanted to confront evil ideas through social influence rather than through violence.

            "charm-effect": "The Lawgiver may confer the power of divinity upon a mortal subordinate, allowing them to taste the power of the Exalted. The Solar touches the subject and uses this Charm. They feel the charge of Solar Essence, and their mind is spiritually opened for just a moment, long enough for them to hear the prayers of the Solar’s cult, like the flutterings of moths. As long as the Exalt keeps this Charm committed, the target may draw Willpower from the Solar’s cult. The subject also gains three specific spirit Charms — two minor miracles, and one major miracle — that fit their most significant Principles. Any time they use the cult-derived point of Willpower to enhance one of their dice rolls to uphold or defend one of their Intimacies, the prayers of the cult are channeled into them for a moment, giving them the Essence they need to perform the Charm for the Charm’s duration. This does not grant the mortal an Essence pool, but allows them to sustain divine, transformative power in accordance with the divinity conferred to them by the Solar and the mystic power generated by her worshipers . The subject loses access to these miracles if the Solar ends her commitment to this Charm. As long as the Solar is continually expanding her cult through overt and subtle miracles, the Willpower her subject draws from the Solar’s cult does not diminish the reservoir of worship (Willpower) the Solar herself draws upon. On Divinity-Conferring Touch (Celestial Exaltation Method) The backer wanted a Charm to uplift his mortal followers with divine status and power. It should be noted that players and Storytellers should work out the details of what kind of spirit Charms should be conferred to the subject in advance. For one who wishes to spy on the Solar’s enemies, thereby upholding a Principle of belief in the Solar’s right to rule, the subject’s major miracle could be something like “Creeping Willow Meditation” in which her flesh becomes as bark and gnarled wood and she winds herself around a tree, melding with it so that she goes completely unnoticed in the forest where conspirators are known to meet. A minor miracle called “Sweet Ivy’s Bliss” would allow her to inflict sudden plant-based toxic necrosis in the skin of someone she touched — for example, if one of the conspirators confronted her as she was leaving the woods.

This armor has stats identical to artifact heavy armor (+11 soak, 10 hardness, -2 mobility), and if the Exalt has mastered the Armored Scout’s Invigoration, Glorious Solar Plate activates its effects for free. Glorious Solar Plate may graft itself over a suit of armor, appearing as a series of interlinked cosmic runes that describe the ascent of the Unconquered Sun to the zenith of heaven at the birth of the universe. This upgrades the armor’s traits if they are lesser than that of Glorious Solar Plate, and adds the armor-enhancing powers of this Charm to the Lawgiver’s current set. If the Solar’s current armor is attuned, grafting Glorious Solar Plate onto it replaces the commitment cost, releasing the attuned motes. For additional purchases, the player may grant Glorious Solar Plate custom Evocations. The player should work with the Storyteller to create Evocations that exude the nature of the Exalt’s iconic anima manifestation. In addition, Glorious Solar Plate has the following powers: Heavens-Blazing Aura: Against energy-based decisive projectiles such as Blazing Solar Bolt and Flight of the Brilliant Raptor, this armor gains [[ {@{essence},3}kh1 ]](the greater of Essence or three) decisive soak. This defense applies even when the Solar is crashed. Unbreakable Sustaining Grip: The armor automatically treats crippling damage to joints and limbs, setting and stabilizing broken bones with binding Essence and channeling the Solar’s pain out through her anima. As a result, the Solar’s limbs cannot be hacked off and her bones and joints can’t be rendered dysfunctional while she is wearing Glorious Solar Plate. Special activation rules: Glorious Solar Plate is expressly allowed to be used in combination with Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana, so that a suit of armor can be quickly donned and simultaneously enhanced by this Charm’s effects. Used on its own, Glorious Solar Plate appears already-equipped, perfectly fitted to the Solar’s form.",

The Exalt can activate this effect when she is asleep, unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, and will not fall off the mount from being asleep or otherwise unconscious during ordinary travel. Against any attack which might knock her from her mount, she gains +1 Defense. Horse-Summoning Whistle: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to call a loyal mount to her side. The mount makes its way to her as circumstances best allow. Master Horseman’s Eye: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively when evaluating a mount to perfectly recognize its strengths and weaknesses. Speed-Sustaining Technique: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively and touch a mount to sustain it for two hours. Effort during that time does not exhaust the creature, and it does not suffer harmful random incidents such as thrown shoes and injured hooves. Spirit-Steadying Assurances: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively to stop a mount from panicking.

Blood Rider’s Toughness: The Solar and her mount are as a single being with one skin.

As long as she is on the deck of a ship, and that ship is touching a body of water, the Exalt can sense both the direction of the Pole of Earth and the North Star, even in broad daylight. The moment she uses this Charm, she knows her exact latitude, longitude, and bearing, and can plot an accurate course without a roll. On Perfect Reckoning Technique Originally this Charm was in the core rules, but I changed that Charm’s name to Safe Bearing Technique in order to have a more powerful version of this classic Solar Charm. Because Creation is flat, getting latitude and longitude works differently. It requires charts that map the course of the sun at certain dates and times of the day, and the use of a backstaff to measure the sun’s angle and distance from the horizon. This is a difficulty 3 roll for those who have been trained (Celestial Navigation specialty in Sail), difficulty 4 for those who have not. Without charts and a backstaff, the difficulty is raised by 2. A Solar with this Charm always knows her position relevant to the sun’s arc even at night, and she can see through sunlight to the North Star even by day. The reason this Charm requires her to be on a ship atop a body of water is because she is “feeling” along the greater surface area of her submerged hull to sense the flow of Water Essence. All bodies of water in Creation, even the Dreaming Sea, are resonant with the Pole of Earth — if one can feel along the Essence that flows through oceans and rivers, one’s sense will inevitably be pulled toward the Pole of Earth. Thus a Solar standing on a ship, floating on water, needs no jade magnet needle to know the direction of the Imperial Mountain in relation to the North.",

            "charm-effect": "They say a sailor’s mistress is the sea. Well, the Solar captain’s only true mistress is death. But not even death would try the crazy shit a Lawgiver captain is liable to pull. When the Solar uses this Charm, her player may introduce a hazard that imperils her ship and one other, that may only be avoided through incredible sailing. Roll the Solar’s Wits + Sail against that of her adversary. If the Solar has the greater result, her maneuvering not only allows her ship to skate through unscathed, but also causes the other ship to wreck spectacularly. This might involve the Solar sailing to the edge of a waterfall and pulling an impossible u-turn as her adversary sails right over the edge, or it might describe a Solar pushing her skyship into a steep descent, so the sun blinds her pursuer and causes them to wreck on a high cliff. However, if the Solar loses the clash of sail, her opponent not only escapes the trap, but it also backfires, doing two damage to the hull of the Solar’s ship. This Charm can be used once per story, but may be reset by using Sail to overcome a distinct disadvantage that threatens your crew or your ship. This Charm can in fact reset itself. Repeatedly, if needs be. On Death-Daring Manuever This Charm is chiefly apocryphal because it is really powerful. The backer wanted a Charm to help him create dangerous hazards he could sail around while other players wreck their shit. If you like it, use it anyway. Without a Willpower cost, you can technically use it repeatedly, provided your ship is damaged or you are suffering wound penalties, or have some other distinct disadvantage. Use it to force a bunch of ships to follow you down a whirlpool and laugh maniacally as you are the only one that sails back out again. Backer: Clear Frozen Skies",

            "charm-effect": "During a pitched naval battle, the Solar’s skills are tested to their utmost. Her sense of her ship and the flow of battle become the avenue for a critical apotheosis of Solar, ship, and skill. In a single moment of transfiguring brilliance, the Lawgiver merges with her vessel and crew, moving them through open air, phasing them from one position to another in order to escape destruction and to unleash an attack of their own. To use this Charm, the Exalt activates it and becomes keenly aware of every flaw in her opponents’ movements. The Solar’s player begins to track all 1s and 2s rolled by enemy captains in the scene. When 15 of these have been accrued, they can be “spent” as special momentum to trigger this Charm’s unique stratagem, in which the ship teleports out of the way of a broadside maneuver (Exalted, p. 245) or other successful attack, phasing her ship out and in at a new position at the same relative distance from the enemy vessel. This counts as an uncontested positioning stratagem (Exalted, p. 245) — roll the Solar’s Wits + Sail and convert the result to momentum. In addition, this momentum can be paid to roll an immediate Broadside attack against the attacking enemy. Master and Commander Method can be used in one scene per story, and within that scene as many times as the Solar can charge it. An Essence 4+ repurchase also allows the Solar to count her enemy’s 3s in order to use it. It can be reset by overcoming a major enemy while sailing under some penalty that cannot be easily rectified through the use of the Solar’s current Sail Charms. On Master and Commander Method The backer wanted a Charm that was as close as possible to the Picard Maneuver from Star Trek, which involves flying your starship at an attacking starship using warp speed to confuse ship sensors and create an illusion of being in two places at once, allowing the phasing ship to launch an unexpected salvo against the confused vessel . The main reason this is apocryphal is because Solar Charms tend to depict one single action and this depicts several. The Solar teleporting her ship and crew over a short distance is a legal effect if it is reasonably hard to do, but this Charm requires the completion of multiple actions that stretches the limits of how Solar magic functions , and it might make the Charm feel like more of an actor than the Solar. As stated in the core rules on page 250, Charms don’t “do” anything. Charms reflect the actions of the Solar. A Solar’s action can entail wholly supernatural expansions of the Ability, but their skill must always be present. Like all other characters in Exalted, Solars are limited to specific actions per round. When a Charm depicts multiple complicated actions being completed that are usually left as round to round interactions of the rules and Storytelling, it starts to mark out the Charm as more of an actor than the Solar. Just remember this is a very apocryphal Charm and you should be wary of treating Solar mechanics this way. Backer: Scott “The Hanged Man” McNabb Corpany",

She not only perceives an Intimacy of respect or fondness between two members, but she sees how their banter creates its own positive Intimacy in other members. Her mind can draw out the interplay of connected Intimacies in this fashion as far as the Storyteller deems relevant. In addition, she perfectly recalls any customary roles or procedures performed by members of the court, even if that seems irrelevant. She might notice that one member takes leave at the same hour every day to walk in the sun, while remembering how another member drinks her tea— both how she holds the cup and what taste she favors. Overall, she is able to predict the movement, placement, mores and usual attitudes of her subjects perfectly, and has a strong understanding of their values and goals.

These Intimacies are purchased as a permanent effect, but the Solar must activate them by taking a dramatic action lasting four or more hours, in which she cloisters herself in a place of solitude and meditates or talks herself into her new persona. Upon entering her new persona, she gains her new Intimacies and temporarily voids her true Intimacies, and gains the following benefits: While this Charm is active, the Solar can act against her true Intimacies without eroding them or having to roll to gain Limit at the end of a scene. Furthermore, the Exalt cannot be impressed or persuaded by her true Intimacies —as if she were another person. The Solar may use her persona’s Intimacies to void social influence against her, but doing so causes her to drag the affected Intimacy or Intimacies into her next persona change, or back to her true set of Intimacies, resulting in confusion as her identities begin to overlap and she begins to think competing thoughts in different voices. Heart-Eclipsing Shroud can be purchased [[@{essence}]](Essence) times, to create [[@{essence}]](Essence) personas. Motes spent activating this effect are not committed: reverting to her true Intimacies or changing to another persona requires that she use the Charm again. Special rules: Upon purchase, the player creates a persona with a number of Intimacies. The player can invest it with as many or as few Ties as needed, but must create a number of new Principles equal to the number of Principles held by the Solar. When creating these Intimacies, the player should think of the persona as a different character with its own thoughts, feelings, and ideas. It is recommended that the player give the persona its own character concept to be reflected in the persona’s Intimacies. The player should aim for a concept and Intimacies which will serve the Solar in her desired social milieu.",

This is the number of Ability dots the player may assign to the persona’s character sheet. The persona cannot have a Craft, Lore, Occult or a Dawn Caste Ability rated higher than the Solar’s own, and may not have a higher number of total dots spread across Dawn Abilities than the Solar has. At least half the dots (rounded up) must go into Eclipse or Zenith Abilities.\n • Halve the Solar’s total experience (round down) and grant this as bonus experience to the persona. This experience cannot be used to change the persona’s Attributes, increase her Willpower or purchase Charms or Merits, but can be used to upgrade Abilities using favored and nonfavored prices. Where the persona shares Abilities with the Solar, it automatically knows Charms the Solar already knows. With the exception of Craft, Lore, and Occult it may also learn Abilities the Exalt does not herself know.\n • Assign specialties: three that line up with the persona’s concept. Additional specialties cost three experience points each. Please note: The Solar inherits these traits upon using the prerequisites to change personas. The first time a Solar undertakes this transition, she does not automatically possess all of the allotted Abilities afforded by this Charm. Immediately after creation, the persona only has access to those traits it shares with the Solar. All other Abilities and specialties must be acquired by spending the normal amount of training time learning them while wearing the persona’s guise. Any outstanding dots in requisite Zenith and Eclipse Abilities must be trained first. Naturally this requires that the Solar spend a considerable amount of time as her alternate self. Once a persona becomes active, it grows along with the Solar, gaining one experience point for every two the Solar accrues. Experience points gained while in the guise of the persona contribute their full amount to the Solar’s experience total, not the persona’s.",

            "charm-effect": "While using Mastery of Small Manners, the Lawgiver has a perfect intuition for social mores. While under its effects, the Lawgiver can use Viper-Scenting Method to augment her sense of social harmonics, such that she automatically notices when a character expresses disfavor toward her, even if they express it indirectly through a gesture, facial expression, disinterest in the Solar’s words, or whispered comments to someone else. The Lawgiver need not be watching or listening for such cues; this Charm points them out to her. Since Mastery of Small Manners makes it impossible to impugn her etiquette, the Solar understands by process of elimination that xenophobic or other personal attitudes make the initiate distrust or dislike her. Still, the Lawgiver does not know the exact context of any Intimacies the character might hold. However, this Charm grants one automatic non-Charm success to reveal such an Intimacy with a read intentions action. On Viper-Scenting Method The backer wanted a Charm to amp up the power of Mastery of Small Manners, helping him to establish himself in a lasting role within a culture. The biggest obstacle to foreign inclusion are the prohibitive biases of members of that culture. This Charm helps the Solar figure out the exact context of those attitudes by aiding her in revealing related Intimacies. By gathering social intelligence , the Solar can work to defeat those who might seek to undermine her position in a foreign society. Backer: Matthew Pascal",

            "charm-effect": "The Lawgiver can seed the minds of others with resounding goodwill or disfavor. This Charm supplements an instill action in which the Solar attempts to raise a target’s Minor Intimacy to Major, or a Major Intimacy to Defining. If the instill action is successful, the target also gains a new Minor Intimacy that reflects the one being increased. Thus a Solar could link “duty to one’s nation” to “appreciation for the captain of the guard.” This Charm fails if the target has Major or Defining Intimacies that directly contradict the proposed Minor Intimacy. Special activation rules: The player must declare what Minor Intimacy they plan to tack on before using this Charm. During the instill action, the declared Intimacy must be a part of the Solar’s pitch. On Energic Influence Technique The backer asked for a Charm that would allow him to take the Defining Principle of a character and turn it into a Defining Tie for a related character. For example, if you love your nation, that Charm could automatically make you love your nation’s leader. We deemed this far too powerful effect, and decided to instead go with something a little more hands-on, that allows a Solar to increase favor with someone by using their goodwill, seeding them with an Intimacy for future use. Note that this Charm can also be used to increase and introduce negative Intimacies. This Charm only moves in one direction, though. You can’t use it to decrease one Intimacy and raise another.

Special activation rules: The player must declare what Minor Intimacy they plan to tack on before using this Charm. During the instill action, the declared Intimacy must be a part of the Solar’s pitch. On Rancor-Raising Spirit I wrote this Charm to demonstrate a more powerful converse of the prerequisite. The Solar can use this to defeat the iniquities that plague her lands, by coupling negative viewpoints onto vehement or convincing obloquy. Some of you might think this Charm doesn’t work by its example, because someone with a positive view of the Guild would have to have a positive view of slavery. But that’s not actually true — the Guild deals in a number of vast enterprises, and this can work to conceal the effects of slave labor. Moreover, it is human nature to overlook or to refuse to see the moral or ethical contradictions in every day life. Evil flourishes thusly. Indeed, there is no other way that it flourishes.",

            "charm-effect": "The Solar can draw on a mutual history or shared experience in order to make a powerful appeal. If the Solar shares a deep emotional connection to a specific society or culture with another character — as represented by an identical Major or Defining Intimacy they both hold — then the Lawgiver may use that bond to convince a target not to take an action the Solar disapproves of. This puts the character in a decision point immediately, without a roll, allowing them to evaluate whether the connection they share with the Solar outweighs the decision they have made. This Charm ignores restrictions on Intimacy use in decision points — the Exalt may use this Charm even if the target has already cited the shared Intimacy in a decision point. Nor does it count as exploiting a Tie to the Solar directly. With a stunt, the Solar can also use a shared experience (such as serving in the same mercenary company during a legendary battle) as a reason for persuasion, even if there is no actual clear Intimacy being shared. This powerful social influence Charm can be used once per story. On Soul-Testing Method The backer wanted a Socialize Charm that would exploit cultural ties to allow him to reason with his enemies . I expanded it so that it would be effective for a much broader set of characters. This Charm augments social bonds and ties that exist between people, basically using the Solar’s legendary reputation and the target’s emotional connection to an event to make them stop and think about what they’re doing.

Using concealment as cover requires a take cover combat action (see p. 198) replacing Dodge with Stealth unless the character is already concealed. In that case, her hiding place counts as cover until she moves out of it or something happens to obviate it, such as flames banishing the shadows she’s crouched in.

If successful, the Solar appears to step into her target’s shadow and bleed away. The Solar takes possession of her target’s senses and motor functions, and can make her victim act against a negative Intimacy or act against something to which he has a positive Minor Intimacy without contest. If the Solar attempts to make her host act against a Major or Defining Intimacy, use the social influence system as normal, though the subject can terminate this Charm by successfully resisting such influence. Abstract Intimacies such as “I refuse to be controlled” or “I cannot be forced to take action” are not valid for the purpose of this Charm— when resolving the effects of Shadow Replacement Technique , treat such Intimacies as nonexistent. (See also the “Intimacies and Roleplaying” sidebar, p. 172.) Unlike other forms of control, a Solar can use Shadow Replacement Technique to force a victim to harm or even kill himself; however, the Solar is subject to damage equal to any suffered by her subject while in possession. While this Charm is active, Vanishing from Mind’s Eye Method can be targeted to the host alone, and costs only five motes to activate.

At Essence 5+, the Solar may use this Charm even when she is not concealed, as long as she is moving through places where visual penalties might apply.

During this time, the Solar examines boltholes, discovers blind-spots and sight-lines, and prepares hiding places. At the end of the hour, roll the Solar’s Wits + Stealth, adding [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic successes. Successes on this roll are available to the Lawgiver as long as the Charm is committed or until spent entirely. These successes can only be used on Stealth attempts within the specific location the Solar patrolled, but the player can parcel them out across multiple attempts, deciding when to use them, and how many to use. The Solar is expressly allowed to use these successes after making the Stealth roll. Special activation rules: Typically this Charm allows the Lawgiver to cover an area the size of a large warehouse or small park. This area can be slightly increased, but the Storyteller should apply a difficulty of 1 or 2 to the roll if the player wants to extend the range of the effect. By spending five points accrued by the Larceny Charm Master Plan Meditation (see Exalted, p. 318), this Charm may be used retroactively, as long as the Solar has the motes. On Stalking Shadow Spirit The backer wanted a Charm that would help him feel like he has Matrix-level knowledge of his surroundings , able to anticipate where others will be looking or standing to simply not be there. Players are encouraged, while spending the successes to augment concealment, to describe their Solar’s manipulation of sight-lines and blindspots, to stand to the left when a guard is facing right, and so on. As a side-note, all Charms that accrue successes for you to use later treat those as “non-Charm” successes unless otherwise stated. Backer: Clete D. Collum",

If the roll for concealment is successful, the Lawgiver moves to a new hiding place within one range band. As her old location is discovered, the Lawgiver must move in order to use this Charm. If the Storyteller deems there are no other places of cover or concealment within one range band, this Charm can’t be used. Extra decisive attack successes used by Shadow-Striking Way cannot be used by hypothetical other Charms that might use them. If the Solar combines this Charm with Shadow-Crossing Leap Technique (Exalted p. 408) lower the cost of that Charm to one mote, one Willpower, and double the automatic successes granted to the Lawgiver’s Stealth attempt. On Shadow-Striking Way The backer wanted a way to attack from concealment and immediately disappear like a deadly shadow. I could tell from his description that he wanted something a little more versatile than Hidden Snake Recoil. The problem with this effect has always been balancing it. Fighting from a state of concealment is prohibitive on purpose. Thus, I balanced this Charm against the significant advantage it confers. Charms that follow Shadow-Striking Way will only enhance it in very gradual ways. Like many Solar Charms, Shadow-Striking Way is a central effect from which small upgrade Charms might radiate outward. Backer: Kalzera of Nugasya",

            "charm-effect": "An Exalt with a familiar has experienced the gift of having been chosen twice. The Exalt reaches through her anima to touch the bond she shares with her companion animal, elevating its spiritual status and according herself the following powers: Unbreakable Loyalty: The familiar gains a Defining Tie of loyalty to the Solar, if it does not already have one. No influence of any kind—other than that of the Solar—can make the familiar act against this Intimacy. Essence-Drawing Method: The familiar becomes a font of spiritual energy. The Solar may reflexively draw up to five motes from her pet once per day. The Exalt must be within short range of the familiar she wishes to tap. If the Exalt taps more than five motes from multiple pets in a scene, the motes she draws will only last until her next turn. Power-Renewing Bond: The Solar draws strength from her familiar bond. Once per day, through interaction with her familiar, the Exalt may draw a single point of Willpower as a simple action lasting at least a few seconds. This contact renews the Solar’s mental energies and can even negate a -1 crippling penalty to the Exalt’s social influence actions. The Solar may only use this power once per day, no matter how many familiars she has. Sense-Riding Discipline: The Exalt may borrow the senses of a familiar through a moment of intense concentration . This simple action requires the Solar to concentrate on pushing her consciousness into the mind of her familiar, rendering her incapable of taking any other actions until she has returned to her own mind. This power can be invoked when the character is asleep or otherwise inactive, and has no known range limitation. At Survival 5, the Exalt further extends her influence into the familiar ’s motor functions, merging seamlessly with her charge in order to control its actions.",

            "charm-effect": "The Solar holds dominion over the beasts of the field. With this Charm she can train an animal, familiar or otherwise , to follow her commands. Through exercise and repeated practice, she can also train the beast to use special abilities that are latent, such as an eagle’s disarm ability (p. 563), or techniques designed by the player or the Storyteller which are appropriate to the animal. Normally, training an animal to unlock its latent potential requires a minimum of Survival 3, and two specialties : one in animal husbandry, and another specific to the animal—falconry for a hawk, lion taming for a great cat, and so on. The trainer makes an extended roll with an interval of one month and a goal of 10, modified by the animal’s attitude—docile and tamed beasts presenting no penalties, familiars representing a number of bonus dice equal to the trainer’s Intimacy to the animal, and hostile, wild, or otherwise untrainable animals representing a penalty of -2 or -3. The trainer must spend the entire month interacting with the beast, teaching it words, signals, commands, and running it through exercises daily. Any significant amount of time the trainer spends away from the beast during this time saps successes away at a rate of one success for every two or three days. Success at the extended roll means that the animal learns to use the technique and can be order to do so on command. A Solar with Beast-Mastering Behavior gains [[@{essence}]](Essence) automatic successes to this roll, and shortens the interval of the roll to one week. Using this Charm exempts her from the specialty requirements of normal training, while the Charm Friendship with Animals Approach may eliminate the penalty associated with wild or hostile animals. At Survival 5+, Essence 3+, the Solar can teach a familiar she has enhanced with Spirit-Tied Pet to use magical abilities , such as the eagle’s special ability Iron Wings Carry. Doing so costs the Solar two experience points per ability trained.The player and the Storyteller can work together to develop new and appropriate abilities for the Solar to teach her familiar. Also at Survival 5+, Essence 3+, the Exalt can use Beast- Mastering Behavior on a familiar she has enhanced with Bestial Traits Technique, to teach it to use a special ability that it can only use during Deadly Predator Method, for a cost of two experience points. Such abilities need not be wholly appropriate for the animal in question. A flying squirrel might gain the power to generate a charge like an electric eel, while a tyrant lizard might learn to spit a fireball from its mouth.",

Her surroundings become primal, shifting in modes and methods unseen since the dawn of time, and her familiar remembers an ancient time and an earlier form in which beasts were the life that beat at the heart of a supreme being. Channeling the Essence of the ancient world through her familiar, the Solar’s honored companion is transformed into a primal beast of war. Deadly Predator Method has the following advantages:\n • The familiar grows immense. Its size grows by 15%, and an additional 10% for every repurchase of Life of the Aurochs. The Solar may waive the growth bonus if she chooses.\n • The familiar’s appearance becomes magnificent and terrifying . Its markings become more extreme, its colors explosive and vibrant. Natural armor such as a shell or carapace becomes spiked and ridged, while natural weaponry such as horns, fangs and tusks grow even more pronounced . The familiar gains [[@{essence}]](Solar’s Essence) automatic successes to intimidate targets. Against much smaller or cowardly opponents, the familiar is automatically intimidating —such enemies suffer a -1 penalty to their attacks against the familiar.\n • The familiar cannot be intimidated, and ignores all fearinducing magic.\n • The familiar gains [[@{essence}]](Solar’s Essence) automatic successes to all movement-based Athletics rolls. Mighty familiars such as bears and boars gain [[@{essence}]](Solar’s Essence) in successes on (Strength + Athletics) rolls. Gigantic familiars gain all of these advantages and increase their minimum strength by (Solar’s Essence x2) for the purposes of which feats of strength they can attempt.\n • The familiar’s withering and decisive attacks gain [[@{essence}]](Solar’s Essence) automatic successes. The creature’s withering damage gains a bonus equal to the Solar’s Essence. For the duration of the Charm, its Initiative does not reset on a successful decisive attack unless the Solar uses Red-Toothed Execution Order.\n • The familiar’s hide grows tough as iron, its bones as hard as diamond, its flesh like granite. It gains five soak against withering attacks, and it becomes invulnerable to decisive attacks. During this time, the transformed familiar can only be hurt by falling from extreme heights or by being crushed by massive vertical tonnage. Even so, such damage will not exceed the familiar’s final health box, leaving it incapacitated but alive when the Charm ends.\n • The familiar may roll Join Battle upon transformation, keeping the higher of its current value or the roll’s result. Smaller animals that do not usually attack gain dice pools comparable to smaller predators and can use appropriate special attacks associated with such animals. For example, a hummingbird gains access to the eagle’s Death Dive attack (see p. 563). Familiars enhanced with Beast-Mastering Behavior may also gain access to a special ability denoted in that’s Charm’s text. While Deadly Predator Method is active, the familiar loses one point of Initiative per round, and if it suffers Initiative crash, Deadly Predator Method ends, and the beast reverts to its mundane form. Deadly Predator Method can only be used once per battle, but can be reset by killing an opponent with Red-Toothed Execution Order.",

Focusing her primal Essence through a mighty shout or the cry of her familiar, the Solar calls upon all natural animals within [[@{essence}]](Essence) miles that match the species of her familiar. These animals assemble into a Size 2 battle group (see Exalted p. 205) with average Drill — elite if they are pack hunters such as wolves or Lions — and Might 0 unless they are diminutive creatures such as rabbits or squirrels, in which case the amplitude of Solar Essence increases their Might to 2. Outside of combat, this battle group takes around ten minutes to assemble unless the assembled beasts are particularly slow. Battle groups of incredibly fast creatures such as hawks can assemble in less than a minute, as can battle groups composed as creatures who are in the immediate vicinity. In combat, assembly takes a number of rounds equal to eight minus the Dexterity of the average member of the battle group, or a single round if the subjects are all nearby or are incredibly swift. The battle group is led by the Solar’s familiar. If the familiar is not present, the battle group will still instinctively attack targets on the Solar’s behalf, and will attempt to follow her if she moves or attempts to flee or indicates a new target for them to savage. War Charms that directly control battle groups are ineffective at leading such a mob, but Survival Charms that enhance the familiar’s own actions allow it to pass on orders and bonuses from the Solar’s War Charms, such as it is able to understand them. Lastly, at Essence 4+, all successful withering attacks made by this battle group award half the Initiative (rounded up) to the Solar’s familiar, if it is present on the battlefield. This Charm has no effect on the familiars of other characters , spirit animals, or an animal that has a Major or Defining Intimacy of hatred for the Solar. On Riotous Cry of the Beast The backer wanted to use his Survival to call up an army of forest creatures to aid him in battle. I expanded the concept to any creature matching the Exalt’s familiar, and conceptualized it as a battle group and tertiary buff for your familiar. This Charm also allows rather “weak” animals to remain valid choices for a familiar. Players are encouraged to conceptualize a Might 2 animal as moving at tremendous speeds, leaping through the air, and fighting with unusual bravery, just like a Solar. Backer: Kristopher Todd",

Using this Charm automatically triggers Saga Beast Virtue, replacing the cost of that Charm entirely. It also makes the size bonuses from all familiar-enhancing Charms non-optional; all take effect while this Charm is active. In addition, the familiar grows massively large. Large creatures grow exponentially; a bull grows larger than a war elephant, while already gigantic creatures grow slightly less, a war elephant growing large enough to peer into a second story window. Smaller familiars become large enough to ride, reaching excesses of 1000 pounds. In addition to the benefits of the prerequisite and Saga Beast Virtue, familiars gain an additional three mutations. The largest familiars (tyrant lizards, mammoths, giant snakes) gain three automatic non-Charm successes to their feats of strength, and may reach into the short range band to attack targets. In addition, targets at short range must roll disengage to move away from such a massive opponent. As targets at close range must also disengage to escape, a target who starts at close range must disengage twice to get away. Such familiars double the hardness from any purchases of Hide-Hardening Practice and gain two additional -4 health levels and three additional -0health levels while this Charm is active. The smaller familiars compensate by gaining three automatic non-Charm successes to rush and disengage, and one automatic success to each of their attacks. They gain two -0 health levels. On Colossal Rampaging Beast The backer wanted another size booster for his familiar, one that would let his smaller creature get large enough to ride.

Lastly, this Charm allows the Solar to use the prerequisite reflexively in combination with itself. At Thrown 5+ Essence 3+, the Solar may use this Charm without using her combat action once per round. On Thunder-Quelling Gesture The Exalt needs to be aware of her target taking aim in order to use this Charm. This Charm does not confer knowledge of whether or not this is happening, so if it is not clearly apparent, the player should consider using Awareness Charms and the prerequisite, Angle-Tracing Edge. With Awareness Charms dedicated to hearing, the Solar could commit herself to listening for the nigh-inaudible pull of a bowstring, and with the appropriate Awareness roll (difficulty or Stealth contest determined by the Storyteller) she could pinpoint the exact position of an archer hiding out of sight, and bounce her missile off a wall or a parapet (via prerequisite) to strike her target and stop them from taking aim. Note that this Charm does not specify who the target is aiming at. Use this Charm to judiciously intercept the slings and arrows that will no doubt be hurled at your Solar’s friends and allies. This Charm was written in response to a backer’s desire to have some defense within the Thrown ability from formidable ranged attacks. It was structured as it is in order to meet that demand without violating the tactical limits of Thrown. Backer: Robert-Sean Harley",

This Charm is a difficulty 4 Thrown gambit that, if successful, will knock down an opponent. Alternately, if the Solar hurls a bola, net, or other snare, then she makes a difficulty 4 Thrown-based grapple gambit against her target. If successful, roll (Strength + Thrown) to establish clinch control, with a number of automatic successes equal to extra successes on the initial attack roll plus one. The control roll cannot be modified by Thrown or other Ability Charms. If successful the target is snared for the number of control rounds plus one. If the number of control rounds exceeds their Strength, they also fall to the ground. A snared character can attempt to struggle free by spending a complete action without a flurry to remove two rounds of control each turn. They can also instantly break free from snares made of non-magical materials (cords, cables, etc) with a Strength 5+ difficulty 5 feat of strength. Lastly, if the Lawgiver has the other end of a line, rope, or other tether hooked to the snare, then if she knows the Brawl Charm Crashing Wave Throw (Exalted p. 275) then she can use it to sling her opponent violently into scenery with a decisive throw. The Solar is considered to have [[ @{essence} + 1 ]](Essence + 1) more Strength than her actual rating for the purpose of this stunt. Damage on this attack resets the Solar to base Initiative. Lastly, unassisted characters must struggle at least one round to remove this snare, even if the control rounds have been completely expended. A net won’t just fall off on its own, and a character bound by the legs and hurled with Crashing Wave Throw isn’t set free by smashing into scenery, even though this forfeits all rounds of control. This gambit can be supplemented by Diving Hawk Discipline. On Whirlwind Hand of the Striker I know it is a complex Charm. Just make sure to record extra successes on the attack roll to apply to the control roll. The Crashing Wave Throw tie-in can be ignored if you don’t have Brawl, but if you want to play a character who hooks people by the legs with a weighted line and then hurls them to a dangle over the rooftops, this is the Charm for you. As an aside, if you want to free a snared character, there are a couple of ways you might do it. A Storyteller should require a character to use their action without a flurry and an appropriate stunt to try to help a friend get free, removing an additional -2 rounds of control. Alternately you might have them try a difficulty 3 gambit to cut the snare loose with an edged, lethal weapon. A botch on the Initiative roll should be rather spectacular.",

Through the use of this Charm, even the worst gutter-sweepings and bandits can be trained into an elite fighting force. This Charm enhances the effects of Drill (p. 206). The Solar’s training regimens are brilliant, ingraining her troops with perfect actions codified from a peerless mind for war. With this Charm, she can train an undisciplined unit up to Average after just a week, and she can instill an Average unit with Elite status after only a month. Any unit which gains Average Drill under the aegis of this training also gains the combat traits of battle-ready soldiers, while any unit raised to Elite Drill gains the combat traits of elite troops (p. 497). In addition, at Essence 3+, the Solar can further enhance an Elite battle group with her transforming will. Demon-Fighting Principle: For 2xp, she can train her elite units to be more effective at fighting ghosts, demons, and other nighted creatures from the haunted tracts of Creation. The battle group gains +2 Might against such foes. Giant-Slaying Tactics: For 2xp, the Exalt’s elite are versed in battle tactics having to do with fighting gigantic opponents . Her forces gain +2 Might against behemoths or other titanic foes. This effect does not stack with Demon- Fighting Principle. Glory of the Inevitable: The Solar’s Tiger Warriors need no truth but life is death, and death comes on the battlefield . For 3xp, she can instill her elite battle group with perfect morale (p. 210), making it impossible to fail a rout check without powerful magical influence.",

At harmony with the universe, the Solar cannot be defeated. This is the Charm of the Dawn Caste generals who tore apart and routed the invincible armies of the Great Masters in the Time Before. When the Exalt’s battle group makes a successful attack against another battle group augmented by an order action, the Solar may use this Charm to take further control of the battle, forfeiting damage and using extra successes on the attack roll to place the enemy under the effects of a new stratagem. In literal terms, the Solar uses her superior knowledge and tactics to control the enemy army, forcing it into a disadvantageous state for the rest of the battle. The Exalt may instead use this Charm to erase a stratagem of equal or lesser value that has been used against her own forces, allowing them to escape from the most harrowing of disadvantages through her military genius. The Solar may deploy up to [[@{essence}]](Essence) additional stratagems with repeated use of this Charm. If any stratagems the Solar deploys seem incompatible, void the incompatible one and increase the severity of disadvantage in a pre-existing penalty. For example, an army trapped in a desert canyon is suffering from lack of water normally, but the compounded stratagem reveals that they are also sinking in quicksand. Increase penalties accordingly.

His request led to the creation of this balanced but tremendously powerful Charm that will greatly reward supernal War characters. Backer: Brent A. Nellis",

            "charm-effect": "When a Solar has a deeply physical and spiritual bond with one of the Lunar Exalted, that Lunar is said to be her bond mate — a tradition going back thousands of years. This Charm is occluded, hidden from the normal roll of Solar Abilities, and only becomes available to the Solar to learn if she has a Defining Tie for her Lunar and vice versa, and if their bond has been deeply established according to the Storyteller. Then, in circumstances where they are touching each other — sparring, one holding the other’s wrist to keep them from going over a cliff, sharing a kiss, etc — the Storyteller may deem that the Solar feels a sudden oneness with her Lunar. The Lunar will feel this same oneness in turn. Roll their combined Essence scores, and if the result is one or greater, the Storyteller describes a numinous moment in which the Solar and Lunar touch mind and soul and become as one. This can be a completely disassociated stream of consciousness event, or it can be a series of images from their past lives. The end of this sequence leaves the Solar capable of learning this Charm. This Charm allows the Solar to physically merge with her Lunar mate, becoming a single entity of divine wrath and living flame for one scene. The combined being resembles a fusion of the Solar’s physical form with her iconic anima, and the spirit-animal of her Lunar mate. This form usually has four arms, has bestial and ethereal traits, such as horns, hair that floats and crackles with lightning, gale force-winds that whip around in her vicinity , and so on. The mote pool for the merged being is the Solar’s current pool + 25, and the health levels of the combined being are equal to the Lunar’s undamaged health levels. As a quick character, the fusion has all of the traits of the Solar, but the players may do the work to assign the merged character its own sheet, giving it the Lunar’s Attributes and the Solar’s Abilities. In any case, the merged Exalt uses all of the Solar’s Charms for actions, but its Attributes on any roll can be enhanced by any Attribute-boosting Charms the Lunar has learned. In addition, the form gains horns, fangs, claws, wings, and other mutations applicable to the Lunar’s spirit form and the Solar’s iconic manifestation, a number equal to the Lunar’s Appearance or Stamina +1. These natural weapons can be used to use animal attacks such as Bite, Gore, and so on, listed in the antagonists chapter of Exalted. To use this Charm, the Exalts must share a Defining Principle that they are merging in order to defend. If they are killed while in this form, they both die. Once they have used this Charm, they may not end their merged form until the end of the scene, though they may choose to end it if they fall into Initiative Crash. On Hallowed Bond of Night and Flame This Charm was written in response to a backer’s desire to see a Charm that uses the Solar / Lunar bond to make a merged being with some combination of Solar and Lunar Charms and appearance. This Charm is hugely apocryphal. If we were to allow something like this to happen normally, we’d require a deeper buildup with a number of requisite Charms and story events. However, it is a delightful Charm and if you really want to use it we hope the Apocryphal keyword won’t get in your way. According to the backer, this Charm was used by her Lunar, Scarlet-Wings-Over-The-Mountain and her Solar lover, Brass Storm Spirit. Storytellers beware, this Charm is mechanically overpowered. Use with caution. Backer: Jennifer Alyxendra Barron",
