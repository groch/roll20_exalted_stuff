Flame weapons instead discharge braided ropes of semi-tangible smoke. She treats the rope as exceptional equipment (Exalted, p. 580), and can use reflexive move actions to climb it, ascending or descending one range band, or to swing along it, moving one range band forward and, optionally, one range band down. Other characters don’t gain the movement benefits , but still treat the rope as exceptional. Alternatively, the Dragon-Blood may fire at an unattended  object within short range that she’s capable of holding in her hands. The Storyteller may require a (Dexterity + Archery) roll in the case of very small objects  or poor visual or weather conditions. If successful, the line attaches to the object and retracts, dragging it to the Dragon-Blood’s feet undamaged. Ropes created with Grasping Vine Shot wither or disperse at end of scene. If the Dragon-Blood has a relevant  Craft, like ropemaking, she receives craft points for meeting objectives with this Charm as though she’d completed a basic project (Exalted, p. 240).

During this time, the Dragon-Blood can’t take any non-reflexive actions or movement actions.

The Storyteller determines how much damage the blast inflicts on mundane scenery and trivial opponents , up to uncountable damage. Affected battle groups must check for rout against difficulty 4. The blast’s other effects depend on its elemental aspect: Air: The sky darkens, pouring down harsh rain or heavy snowfall accompanied by gale-force winds and flashing lightning. • Precipitation imposes a –2 penalty on all vision- or hearing-based rolls. • Winds impose a –3 penalty on movement actions, ranged attacks, and similar rolls. • Airborne characters and trivial opponents treat all movement as difficult terrain. • Characters exposed to the storm suffer an environmental  hazard with difficulty 2, Damage 10L/hour; a failed roll indicates they’ve been struck by lightning. The storm lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, but can be dispersed earlier through magic or the creative actions of characters. Earth: The land shakes and grinds horrifically as seismic  tremors shudder through it. • All characters within range must make a difficulty 3 (Dexterity + Athletics) balance roll or fall into a yawning chasm, suffering falling damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232) unless they find a way to mitigate it. Climbing out requires a difficulty 3 ([Dexterity or Strength] + Athletics) roll, although characters may escape by other means, such as Monkey Leap Technique. • The damage wrought by the earthquake renders the entire area difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199), and the speed of any long-range travel through the affected area is halved. Fire: A roaring conflagration engulfs the land, setting the world ablaze. • All characters suffer a one-time environmental hazard  with difficulty 5, Damage 6L. • Forests, grasslands, wooden structures, and other flammable terrain catches fire and continues to burn with a lesser intensity (difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round) until they’re extinguished or no fuel remains. • A haze of smoke and ash hangs over the affected area, imposing a –2 penalty on any vision- or scentbased  rolls. This lasts (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, unless dispersed earlier by natural weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters, and may last longer if large regions remain  ablaze. Water: A swirling pillar of water descends from the sky or rises from the sea, before dispersing in all directions as a crushing tidal wave. • Depending on a character’s proximity to the Dragon- Blood, the amount of time they have to prepare for the wave’s impact varies — those within long range are struck by it instantly, without an opportunity to seek cover, while someone miles away from her might have minutes to prepare. • Characters unable to reach a place of safety before  being hit must make a difficulty 5 ([Strength or Stamina] + Athletics) roll to avoid being carried away. If they fail, they’re knocked one range band away from the Dragon-Blood per success they failed by. If this movement is interrupted by hitting a barrier, the character takes damage as though he’d suffered a fall from a height equal to the number of range bands of movement prevented. • Ships caught in this wave suffer ten dice of Hull damage . Captains can roll (Wits + Sail) to avoid the worst of it, subtracting one die of damage per success. • The blast is also likely to cause mass flooding in valleys  and similar areas. Wood: Gigantic vines burst from the ground, bearing vibrant flowers that bloom with toxic pollen. • The overgrowth renders the entire area difficult terrain and halves the speed of long-term travel through it, although travelers can potentially bypass this by setting fire to the vines or destroying them through other means. • Pollen imposes a –3 penalty on scent-based rolls. • The pollen is also an inhaled poison. The first time a character breathes in the affected area, and after each hour of exposure thereafter, they must roll against a poison with Damage 1B/minute, Duration 10 minutes, and a –3 penalty. The vines remain until destroyed, but their flowers wilt after (Dragon-Blood’s successes/2) hours, rounded up, ending the pollen haze. It can be dispersed earlier by natural  weather, magic, or the creative actions of characters. The Dragon-Blood’s Hearthmates can contribute their Auras to this Charm, as long as they remain within short range and abide the same restrictions she does. Only one Aura of each element can be contributed, adding a non-Charm die on the Lore roll and conferring  that element’s effects on the blast. The effects of different elements will combine without cancelling one another — Water and Fire, for example, would combine to unleash a scalding tsunami hot enough to set the battlefield afire. After using this Charm, the Dragon-Blood and all Hearthmates that contributed Auras suffer a –4 fatigue penalty on all rolls. Each full night’s rest lowers the penalty  by one; until it’s fully removed, affected characters can’t regain Willpower from rest. This Charm can only be used once per story or year, whichever is longer. Backer: Ashley Thompson "

Created armor or clothing normally lasts until the scene ends, but the Dragon-Blood can commit four motes after that to maintain it indefinitely. Regardless of the option the Dragon-Blood employs, she gains benefits based on the invoked element: Air: Air-wreathed armor is nigh weightless, gaining the Buoyant and Silent tags (Exalted, 593). Additionally, its mobility penalty is reduced by one when applied to the Dragon-Blood’s Evasion.

Her victim’s belief in the hallucinations counts as a Major Intimacy for the poison’s duration.
