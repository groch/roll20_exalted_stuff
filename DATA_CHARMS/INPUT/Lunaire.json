If she wins Join Battle and uses her first turn to make a decisive attack against such an enemy, it doesn’t reset her Initiative. • Once during this Charm’s duration, upon successfully  defeating a formidable enemy — whether in combat, debate, etc. — who she knows has violated the custom, she rolls (his Essence) dice, gaining Willpower equal to the successes, which can raise her temporary Willpower above her permanent Willpower rating, and loses one Limit for each 10. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal or legendary social goal that reinforces the custom’s importance or benefits its culture. "

To do so, she must fully master the land she wishes to claim. She must physically traverse the majority of the region. Any mortal communities living in the territory must accept her presence — they need not make her their leader, but must acknowledge her presence and that they lack the ability or desire to force her out. Finally, if any supernatural beings — such as spirits or fellow Exalted — occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Lunar must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. Land already claimed by another Lunar’s Boundary- Marking Meditation can’t be taken from him unless he voluntarily relinquishes it or dies. Upon claiming a territory, the Lunar’s player chooses three qualities that describe it, e.g. fertile, shadowy, and dense for a thick forest, or open, windy, and guarded for a steppe village. When a character within the territory takes an action that’s supported by any of these qualities, like foraging in a fertile woodland, he’s treated as having an applicable specialty. When a character takes an action opposed by a quality, like a general enacting a Strategic Maneuver roll to march a large army through the dense forest, each such quality  imposes a −1 penalty. The Lunar never suffers these penalties. She can reflexively render a character she perceives immune to her territory’s penalties, or deny him its benefits. Story events may cause a territory to lose qualities — if the forest burns down, it’s no longer shadowy or dense. Once per story, the Lunar may change a territory’s qualities, replacing lost qualities and potentially swapping  existing qualities for new ones as fits the story. A Lunar can’t have more than (higher of Essence or 3) territories. Her control of a territory ends if she voluntarily  revokes it, or upon her death.

The Charm’s duration increases to (Essence) hours. She makes an influence roll as normal, but need not maintain a performance to sustain its effect. Affected characters within medium range of the feature hear unintelligible whispers in the rustling of the leaves and the songs of birds, drawing them irresistibly toward it.

Each territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation gains a virtual health track of seven health levels: one −0, two −1s, two −2s, one −4, and one Incapacitated level. When the Lunar suffers decisive damage within a territory, she may divert up to half that damage, rounded down, into that territory’s health track. Alternatively, she may negate a botch or loss of Willpower from a disease while in a territory at the cost of one level of damage to it. Damage to the Lunar’s territory manifests as withered plants, barren soil, disease-ridden animals, etc. The territory ’s wound penalty is imposed on Survival rolls to forage or find shelter within it, and Craft rolls to create objects from its natural resources. The territory heals one level of damage each month. If it’s enhanced by Moon-and-Earth Blessing, it heals one level of damage each week, but Moon-and-Earth Blessing’s bonus successes don’t apply while the territory’s −1 levels or deeper are damaged. While in a territory, the Lunar may forgo healing one level of damage in her own health track to heal a level in the territory’s health track. At the Storyteller’s discretion , this can also undo blights, infestations, or curses upon the land. If a territory’s health track is completely undamaged and it’s enhanced by Moon-and-Earth Blessing, the Lunar may forgo healing levels of damage  in her health track to increase Moon-and-Earth Blessing’s bonus to four automatic successes for a number  of weeks equal to the levels of healing she forgoes. During this time, her territory evinces supernatural fertility, with plants growing to many times their usual size and animals exhibiting incredible vitality."

She creates a copy of her current form within close range, complete with convincing  (if non-functional) duplicates of her equipment. It lacks true intelligence or agency, and can’t make actions  requiring rolls, but it’s a realistic imitation of her. It can’t move beyond medium range from the Lunar; doing so causes it to revert to whatever it was created from. The duplicate uses the Lunar’s Evasion, Parry, and Guile. If hit by an attack, it dissipates in a silver flash. Characters with superhuman or magically enhanced senses can roll (Perception + Awareness) against its Guile to identify it as a fake. Additionally, the duplicate’s limited ability to carry on conversation means that characters who converse with it for a few minutes can identify it as false with a successful read intentions roll. Using this Charm lets the Lunar reflexively roll Stealth to enter concealment, even without a hiding place. Enemies whose opposed rolls fail believe she’s the duplicate  and the duplicate is her, although they can see through this concealment if they subsequently identify the duplicate as false. This Charm can be stacked to create up to (Essence + 5) total duplicates. Activations past the first costs one mote.

When she uses Emerald Grasshopper Form to become a Minuscule Size animal, she may become a swarm. She must pay four motes on each subsequent turn to maintain this. Her swarm-shape loses Minuscule Size’s effects, gaining  the following instead: • She gains (lowest of Dexterity, Stamina, or Wits) temporary −0 health levels. These temporary levels are the first to be filled when she takes damage, and vanish when filled. • She gains a swarming attack with light weapon  traits (Accuracy +4, Damage +7, Defense +0, Overwhelming 1) and the Lethal, Brawl, Flexible, Grappling, Natural, and Piercing tags. Swarming attacks apply to all enemies within close range, using one attack roll. On withering attacks, only the highest damage roll awards Initiative. On decisive attacks, she divides her Initiative evenly among all hit enemies (rounding  up) to determine the damage rolled against them. On gambits, she likewise divides her Initiative evenly among hit enemies (rounding up) for Initiative rolls, though she need only pay the gambit’s Initiative cost once. Grappling has additional rules, detailed below. Swarming attacks are incompatible with Simple Charms. • On a successful grapple, she makes one (Strength + Brawl) control roll opposing each enemy she succeeded against on the Initiative roll. On each turn of the clinch, she may either restrain all foes, expending two rounds of control over each of them; make one withering or decisive savaging  attack against all clinched foes, as described above; or release all foes. • She can’t use Parry to defend. She gains +3 Evasion, halves the minimum damage of withering  attacks against her, rounded down, and subtracts one level of damage from decisive attacks against her. These benefits don’t apply against weapons with the Flame or Siege tags, attacks enhanced by magic capable of striking multiple enemies or an area of effect, or other effects the Storyteller deems capable of harming the entire swarm. She’s immune to grapples, unless enhanced with magic that could feasibly constrain her swarm-self. • Human-sized or smaller characters suffer a −3 penalty on rolls opposing her rushes or disengages , and rolls to disengage from her.

Once the spirit is freed, he gains a Defining Intimacy reflecting his animal vessel’s nature and his experiences  during the imprisonment — a demon sealed inside a watchdog might form a Tie of loyalty to its master; a god imprisoned in a deer might form a Tie of fear toward predatory animals.

Those who enter are tested; those found worthy emerge blessed with bestial power. The Lunar spends five days laboring  to create a testing ground in a demesne or the Wyld: meditating, performing austerities, bargaining with spirits, etching occult geoglyphs, etc. It’s imbued with the Essence of the Lunar’s spirit shape; a mortal who successfully completes  its trial receives six dots of mutations reflecting that animal, chosen by the Lunar when she uses this Charm. Lunars with Chimera-Soul Expression (p. 143) choose two sets of mutations per trial ground, reflecting both animals making up their spirit shape; successful participants receive whichever best fits their personality and their triumph’s nature. These mutations are hereditary, letting Lunars establish great beastfolk lineages. The Lunar doesn’t choose the trial’s nature; it emerges from her spirit shape’s nature and the Essence of the demesne or the Wyld. Her player should work with the Storyteller to determine what form the trial takes. It might be a challenge of physical, social, or mental prowess; a test of character or Intimacies; or an ordeal with no single solution. Whatever form it takes, failure carries significant consequences — not necessarily death, but maiming, curses, Derangements, and other afflictions are all possible. A character can only attempt  a single such trial ever, pass or fail — she can’t subsequently benefit from other trial grounds, even those created by different Lunars. These factors limit the creation of beastfolk en masse. If the Lunar ends this Charm before the story she used it in ends, the testing ground loses its power. Once the story ends, the testing ground becomes permanent, no longer requiring committed motes and persisting past the Lunar’s death. However, testing grounds can be destroyed by building manses over their demesnes, or by permanently shaping the Wyld containing them into Creation with magic such as Wyld-Shaping Technique. (Harmony-With-Reality Technique won’t destroy testing grounds.) A Lunar can’t have more than (Intelligence + Willpower) permanent testing grounds. Testing grounds in territories  she’s claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation (p. 176) don’t count toward this limit. "

At minimum, this guarantees that the Lunar, her Solar mate, anyone she has a positive Major or Defining Tie toward, and any territories claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation won’t be killed or destroyed as a direct result of the foretold doom. If a prophecy the Lunar is unaware of would harm anyone or anything this Charm could protect from certain destruction , she can use this Charm unconsciously, warned of the impinging weight of destiny by a creeping sense of dread. Example: A Solar predicts a star will fall on Mahalanka with God-King’s Shrike. Raksi uses this Charm, beating his successes. She declares that a spear fashioned from the bones of a certain constellation-god can turn aside the star. Raksi kills the god, creates the spear, and splits the star in half with it. Its fragments still cause destruction , but less than if the star had fallen unbroken, and they won’t kill Raksi or those she cares for. "

Alternatively, it may be reset by completing  a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134). Example: A Solar uses Hypnotic Tongue Technique to command Anja Silverclaws to kill a forest-god, the leader of a troublesome spirit court. Anja uses Commanded to Fly to add the stipulation that she must take the Solar’s shape and carry out the god’s murder while wearing it — a task that’s merely inconvenient, as she has a Charm to take shapes by gambling, and the Solar seems an easy mark. However, if she had a Defining Tie to the Solar, and no way to take his form without killing him, this stipulation would be unacceptable influence, so she couldn’t add it. Likewise, she couldn’t add a stipulation that she kill the god without using any of her Exalted might or weaponry, as the spirit is dangerous enough to make this a life-defining task. "

She makes a special (Manipulation + [Larceny, Performance, or Presence]) instill roll against a single target. If she succeeds, she prevents him from noticing one thing present in the scene — a character, object, natural feature, etc. Inanimate things that span more than a single range band can’t be concealed. The Lunar must continue speaking to maintain this concealment, doing so as a reflexive action on each of her turns. If the Lunar prevents her victim from noticing another character, this functions as though that character had successfully made a Stealth roll to establish concealment  against her victim, including the potential to make surprise attacks. If that character breaks concealment  by attacking or taking other overt actions, this Charm ends. If the Lunar conceals an object, terrain feature, or other  inanimate thing, the target can’t notice it with any sense except touch. He could be rendered unaware of the sword sheathed at his side, the flames raging in a burning building, or the sudden drop of a cliff as he chases the winged Lunar toward it. While he may walk heedlessly into perils, he becomes aware of them with enough time to at least attempt to mitigate harm — if he fell off a cliff, he could attempt an Athletics roll to grab onto the cliffside before falling. If the Lunar’s misdirection imperils one of her victim’s Defining Intimacies — for example, if a concealed assassin moves to cut down his beloved husband — the victim may spend one Willpower to resist this influence. Otherwise, this influence can’t be resisted with Willpower. This Charm can only be used on a character once per story. Protean: In shapes that her target has a Defining Tie of curiosity, fascination, love, desire, etc. toward, the Lunar adds (Essence) successes on her roll. "

When she would gain anima, she can displace those levels onto a character within medium range marked with Devil’s-Eye Brand, committing two motes per level. Un-Exalted victims manifest the Lunar’s own anima, with her distinctive colors and iconic display; Exalted victims instead flare their own anima banners. The victim’s false Tell becomes impossible to conceal while his anima level is glowing or higher, and he suffers the normal Stealth penalties (p. 130); un-Exalted victims gain no benefits from this anima banner. Characters whose anima is already at bonfire can’t be affected. If the Lunar ends this Charm before her victim’s anima banner has fully subsided, or if the false Tell fades before that, all displaced levels of anima return to her, adding to her own. If the Lunar uses this Charm multiple times in the same scene to displace her anima onto the same character , she waives the Willpower cost of subsequent activations. "

During a scene where the Lunar isn’t present, she can use this Charm to reveal that a human or animal already present whose form she could take is actually her. She gains its heart’s blood as a retroactive sacred hunt, and must pay the cost to shapeshift into it, muting the cost. This can only be used to replace narratively unimportant  characters, and never powerful beings such as Exalted or spirits — in a scene set at a prince’s court, the Lunar couldn’t replace the prince, one of his trusted viziers, or the captain of the palace guard, but could replace a servant or a rank-and-file guard. She couldn’t declare that the rogue yeddim stampeding through Nexus is actually her, but could reveal that she’s been the songbird singing from a tree, or a fly buzzing around a satrap’s meal (assuming she has Emerald Grasshopper Form). For the scene’s duration, characters cannot roll to read her intentions, profile her, or spot her Tell — her presence there is proof she hasn’t been found out. Only Eye of the Unconquered Sun or similarly mighty magic can reveal her. If the Lunar initiates hostilities after using this Charm, she may potentially launch an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). This Charm represents the Lunar’s deft skill at infiltration  and impersonation. If the Storyteller deems it implausible for her to appear in a scene — for example, if it’s set in a fortress whose guards are on the lookout for shapeshifters, or the manse of a Dragon-Blood with potent Awareness and Investigation Charms — he may require a (Manipulation + [Larceny, Socialize, or Stealth]) roll against an appropriate difficulty to succeed, maximum 10. Successfully circumventing an Imperial military camp’s guards might be difficulty 2-4, depending on the quality of the troops posted, while sneaking under the notice of an all-seeing Solar or infiltrating a meeting of gods and Sidereals might be difficulty 10. On a failed roll, she’s unable to enter the scene. Even if successful, she must still explain how she’s insinuated herself into it. However, assuming the Lunar succeeds on the roll and contrives an appropriate  explanation, there are no circumstances whereby it’s truly impossible for her to infiltrate a scene as long as a viable candidate for replacement is present. This Charm can only be used once per story. An Essence 5 repurchase requires False Moonrise Phantasm, and lets the Lunar pay a fifteen-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm in scenes where she’s already present. In addition to replacing another character present in the scene, she reveals that the person that seemed to be her was someone else that the Lunar passed off as a perfect duplicate of herself  at some point during the last round. She can use this Charm to evade an attack’s damage after it’s rolled; doing so requires her to make a roll, as above, against a difficulty equal to the total levels of damage dealt."

When she uses Far-Seeing Storm Crow, she may pay a thirty-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to introduce the fact that her target’s weakness will doom him in a coming challenge. The roll’s difficulty is (victim’s Essence), plus a modifier depending on the severity of the foretold doom: +0 for events causing serious complications for her victim, such as a debt-ridden merchant’s creditors calling in what he owes or a prideful tyrant facing opposition from a political rival; +3 for a severely dangerous peril, such as a merchant’s creditors  sending hired thugs to violently coerce repayment or a covert attempt at poisoning a tyrant; or +5 for a life-altering catastrophe, such as a merchant being enslaved by his creditors  or a mass rebellion breaking out in a tyrant’s kingdom. To enact her prediction, the Lunar must inform her victim  of it — and how he might avert it, specifying a course of action that, if accomplished within (5 + his Integrity) days, will prevent the doom. By default, this can be no greater than an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216); she can specify a serious task with 3+ extra successes or a life-changing task with 6+ extra successes. Regardless of severity, the task must be one that the Storyteller deems the victim could feasibly complete within the allotted time span. The disaster is also averted if the Lunar releases  her mote commitment prematurely, or goes a full day without reminding the target of the oncoming doom and the flaw that caused it. If this Charm’s victim can’t avert the foretold doom, it’s sure to happen. The specifics may vary from the Lunar’s prediction based on how events unfold in play, but her target will face a crisis of appropriate severity. However, he’s not assured to fail. Successful rolls, creative  thinking, allies’ assistance, and other assets can mitigate the overall harm and impact of the crisis. This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset  by accomplishing a legendary social goal (Exalted, p. 134) by exploiting a character’s greatest flaw or convincing  a character to overcome his greatest weakness."

The maximum size of enemy she can devour depends on her current shape’s size: • In Legendary Size shapes, she can devour any enemy without Legendary Size. • In shapes larger than a human, she can devour any enemy smaller than a human. • In human-size or smaller shapes, she can only devour enemies with the Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size Merits. • In shapes with Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size, she can only devour Minuscule Size foes smaller than her current form. She suffers none of the usual clinch penalties, but her victim does. He can’t attack anyone but her, and may suffer other restrictions the Storyteller deems appropriate. The Lunar can’t use normal grapple actions against a swallowed foe, other than releasing him by spitting him out. Instead, on each of her turns, he suffers a difficulty 5, damage (Lunar’s Essence)L environmental hazard from her digestive fluids. If this incapacitates him, she can either spit him out, leaving him alive but unconscious, or fully digest him, killing him and spitting out any indigestible equipment. The Lunar doesn’t lose rounds of control when she’s attacked, although she still does when damaged. If damage reduces her rounds of control to zero, it tears open a hole in her flesh for her victim to escape through, and she suffers an unavoidable level of lethal damage. If she changes into a shape insufficiently large to contain the devoured foe, she reflexively spits him out before completing the transformation. "

Success diminishes the shaping — the Lunar can’t be altered in a way that prevents her from shapeshifting or using her Charms, and if a transformation would be permanent or fatal, the Storyteller devises a condition by which it may be broken. The Lunar doesn’t automatically  learn the condition, but appropriate Lore, Medicine, or Occult rolls may reveal it. Alternatively, against any magic that would force the Lunar out of a form she’s shapeshifted into, such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun (Exalted, p. 273), she may use this Charm to force an opposed roll, as above, doubling 9s.

If the Storyteller deems that the influence is too complex for her diminished mind to understand, she may reject it as unacceptable (Exalted, p. 220).

This Charm can only be used once per story, unless reset by experiencing Limit Break (p. 136). Example: An imprisoned demon successfully persuades Rhanka Three-Toe to retrieve the jeweled sphere that can free it from its prison-shrine. She uses Beast-Mind Metanoia to reduce her cognitive faculties to a dog’s. The Storyteller deems that a dog can comprehend retrieving the sphere, but that using it to free the demon would be entirely beyond it. Thus, the influence only compels Rhanka to obtain the sphere, after which she’s free to do as she pleases with it.

If circumstances render this implausible — for instance, because the Lunar is being ambushed on unfamiliar ground — the Storyteller may require a stunt to explain how she devised the trap so quickly. This is an unblockable, undodgeable grapple gambit at difficulty 4 against an enemy within medium range. The Lunar makes a single (Wits + [Survival or an applicable Craft]) roll as both the attack roll and the grapple’s control roll. Her victim opposes the control roll with a (Perception + Awareness) or (Dexterity + Dodge) roll. If the attack is unexpected, the enemy suffers  a penalty on this opposed roll equal to the Lunar’s Initiative roll extra successes, and it doesn’t break concealment . This isn’t compatible with Strength Charms, Martial Arts Charms, or other non-Wits magic that enhances grapples. If successful, the trap establishes a clinch (Exalted, p. 200). The Lunar can’t take the usual special grapple actions, but doesn’t suffer any penalties. A trapped character can spend his entire turn to reduce the clinch’s rounds of control by two. Likewise, a character that spends her entire turn assisting the victim subtracts  two rounds of control. Attacking or damaging the Lunar doesn’t subtract rounds of control. If the Lunar has a relevant Craft, a successful clinch grants three silver points. If a nontrivial opponent is incapacitated or surrenders while trapped, she also gains (his Essence) gold points. This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless reset by landing a decisive attack from Initiative 15+ that resets the Lunar’s Initiative, or successfully establishing  concealment against all enemies with a Stealth roll. A Wits 5 repurchase lets the Lunar raise the gambit’s difficulty to 6 to combine it with the effect of a disarm , distract (transferring five Initiative), or unhorse gambit, as long as she establishes at least one round of clinch control.

Enemies traversing the territory suffer  a difficulty (Lunar’s Essence), Damage 1B/hour environmental hazard: extremes of temperature, foul weather, rockslides, etc. Enemies can avoid the hazard by finding a shelter with a Survival roll and remaining within it. Inhospitable: The Lunar destroys natural resources, convinces spirits to withhold their bounty from outsiders , and otherwise denies foes any respite. Enemies suffer a penalty of (Lunar’s Essence) successes on rolls to forage or find shelter. Botches result in them encountering a significant natural danger, like a bear inhabiting the cave they’d hoped to rest in. Terrifying: Strewing grotesque displays throughout her territory, carving unsettling glyphs, or pacting with spirits of night and shadow, the Lunar imbues her lair with supernatural menace. Enemies within it are treated as having a Minor Tie of fear toward the land. Enemy battle groups suffer a −1 penalty on rout checks within it, and Strategic Maneuver rolls to deploy enemy  troops within it cost a point of Willpower. The Lunar and her allies add two non-Charm successes on rolls to enact the Demoralized stratagem (Exalted, p. 212). The Lunar may stack this Charm to grant a territory multiple effects. Subsequent activations cost only five motes, though if the Lunar ends the original activation, she must immediately commit the full cost for another. A Wits 5, Essence 4 repurchase lets the Lunar grant a new effect: Diseased: The Lunar creates pools of standing water that breed disease-carrying mosquitoes, spreads rabies among wildlife, or bargains with disease gods. Enemies within her territory must contend with her choice of cholera, plague, or rabies (Exalted, p. 235). The frequency at which they must roll depends on the disease: daily for rabies, or weekly for cholera or plague. Characters can avoid the roll by recognizing the signs of the disease (for example, diagnosing a traveling  companion who’s contracted it), introducing a fact about how it’s spread, and then taking appropriate measures, such as avoiding drinking from cholera-ridden  water sources. With Essence 5, the Lunar can inflict hemorrhagic fever, which must be rolled against monthly. "
