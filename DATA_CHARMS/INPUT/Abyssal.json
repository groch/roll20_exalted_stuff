The Abyssal makes a special decisive attack against all characters within short range of a point within her weapon’s range., without needing to aim. The roll is difficulty 1 by default, but the Storyteller may increase it for especially tricky shots. If successful, the projectile pierces through reality, a void that draws in everything within close range. Characters within short range of the projectile must roll (Stamina + Resistance) or (Dexterity + Athletics) against the Abyssal’s attack roll. Battle groups suffer a −4 penalty. Those who fail this roll are pulled into close range of the void and fall prone. Affected target suffers (Abyssal’s Essence) dice of decisive damage as the void tears flesh from bone, plus an additional die of damage for each success by which the Abyssal’s roll beats theirs, up to a maximum of the deathknight’s Initiative. This damage ignores Hardness and doesn’t reset the Abyssal’s Initiative. Special activation rules: If the Abyssal uses Sun-Swallowing Voracity together with this Charm, it extinguishes all light within medium range of where the projectile falls, as well as those it passes within short range of.

For each point of Willpower he loses, one of his positive Intimacies is weakened by one step. Defining Intimacies can’t be affected unless the damage dealt exceeded the target’s base Resolve. The Abyssal can target specific Intimacies she’s aware of; otherwise, the Storyteller chooses. The victim may resist this by paying an additional Willpower for each Intimacy he wishes to preserve If this attack incapacitates the Abyssal’s victim or reduces his Willpower to zero, he loses all memories associated with any Intimacies that are completely eroded. If someone or something reminds him of an Intimacy, he may pay three Willpower to regain his memories of it. Reset: Once per scene.

Anima banners’ radiance is diminished, as if they were one step lower. • The darkness counts as a shadowland, although it doesn’t open into the Underworld. • It counts as being night for relevant effects.

            "Description": "Wraiths of smoke and spectral metal emerge from the deathknight’s outstretched hand, cast off to be her roving eyes. The Abyssal can create up to (Essence) wraiths, paying three motes each. The wraiths acts as an extension of her perception, allowing her to make Awareness rolls based on any sense as though she were in a wraith’s position. Additionally, she can ignore penalties on non-Awareness action from darkness, mist, or other sensory impediments if at least one wraith would not suffer them from its vantage. If Countless Grasping Phantoms is active, that Charm’s spectral sense of touch is also conveyed through the wraiths, extending its effect to encompass characters within short range of any wraith as well as the Abyssal. The wraiths appear within close range of the Abyssal. On each of her turns, she can reflexively move a single wraith one range band, or use her movement action to reflexively move each wraith one range band. As dematerialized entities, they are capable of passing through walls and similar material obstructions. They can’t move beyond long range from her. The wraiths are immaterial. Against magic capable of attacking dematerialized targets, they have Evasion (Abyssal’s Perception), and can be destroyed with a difficulty 3 gambit. They can’t be targeted by normal withering or decisive attacks. If the Abyssal conceals herself with a Stealth roll, the wraiths also receive the benefits of her roll against enemies capable of perceiving dematerialized targets. The Abyssal may purchase the following upgrades for her wraiths for three experience points or one bonus point each: Dauntless: The difficulty of gambits to destroy the wraiths increases to (Abyssal’s Essence + 3, maximum 6). Eager: The cost of creating wraiths past the first is reduced by two motes. Enduring: The Charm’s duration is extended to one day. Far-Roving: The wraiths’ maximum range increases to (Perception + Essence) range bands. Haunting: Rather than creating a stationary wraith, the Abyssal can create one that ceaselessly pursues an individual she can see, manifesting within close range of him and following him unfailingly out to its normal range limits. Insightful: The Abyssal can make profile character and read intentions rolls through her wraiths. Legion: The maximum number of wraiths is increased to (Perception + Essence). The player may work with the Storyteller to create new upgrades. "

She must still make Awareness rolls as usual to focus on details, adding (Essence) non- Charm successes on such rolls. • For particularly dramatic and noticeable things — a bonfire anima, a warstrider on the march, a bellowing tyrant lizard — the Abyssal can perceive them as long as they’re within (Essence) miles of her lair, or (Essence x5) miles while using the applicable Inhuman Perfection of (Sense). • Enemies within range of the Abyssal’s senses can’t make unexpected attacks against her, even if she failed to beat their Stealth roll. • Ghost Sentinel Technique’s range is extended to encompass the entirety of her lair.

This doesn’t speed physical labor carried out by the organization’s members, but rather affects planning, authorization, allocation of resources, and similar bureaucratic tasks. The Abyssal must interact with the organization to use this Charm, but need not lead it — soliciting the task or aiding the organization with it is sufficient. With Essence 2, the time needed to complete a task is instead reduced by (Essence) degrees — for example, if obtaining a loan from a ghostly trade consortium would normally take a month, an Essence 2 Abyssal could obtain it in a day, an Essence 3 Abyssal could obtain it within minutes, and an Essence 4 Abyssal could obtain it almost instantly.

The Abyssal expresses one of her Major or Defining Intimacies through her leadership of an organization, requiring her to spend a scene engaged with that an organization in a way that supports the Intimacy. Examples include making a dramatic speech to her followers, promulgating a set of rules, or employing Eloquent Example Inspiration. All organization members who witness this or hear of it from others intuitively realize the Abyssal’s Intimacy. This has the following effects: • All organization members who are aware of the Abyssal’s Intimacy gain its benefits as if they had it themselves, but it can’t be leveraged against them with social influence. A character who violates the Intimacy loses this benefit. • The Abyssal adds (Essence) dice on influence rolls against group members that align with the Intimacy. • The Abyssal adds (Essence) on Awareness, Investigation, and Socialize rolls against group members to uncover violations of the Intimacy. If the Abyssal chooses a negative Tie, a positive Tie whose object is dead or undead, or a Principle that expresses a positive view on death, the added dice are non-Charm and this Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes. The Abyssal can stack this Charm to affect multiple organizations, and can use it up to (Essence) times on each organization. With a Bureaucracy 5, Essence 4 repurchase, the Abyssal can pay a seven-mote surcharge to actually impose the Intimacy on organization members, rather than only granting its benefits. Characters with positive Defining Ties to the Abyssal when she uses this Charm can’t voluntarily erode the imposed Intimacy. If such a character has the imposed Intimacy at Defining intensity, they can treat any influence it opposes as unacceptable. Resisting this influence requires spending three Willpower for day over (Abyssal’s Essence) different days, after which a character can begin weakening the Tie. The Abyssal can only have one such enhanced use of Accursed Overlord Authority at a time. "

Additionally, when the Abyssal uses a nontrivial character’s remains for a major project, the cost for her first roll is reduced by (victim’s Essence) silver points. If she killed him herself, it’s reduced by (applicable Craft) points, if that’s higher. With Craft 5, Essence 3, the Abyssal can enhance superior projects using the remains of supernatural beings. She reduces the first roll’s gold point cost by (victim’s Essence/2, rounded up). She doesn’t halve her victim’s Essence if she killed him herself. Creating soulsteel artifacts always qualifies for this benefit, treating soulforged ghosts as Essence 1 unless they’ve already been established as characters. "

When the Abyssal is exposed to a Shaping effect, she can defend with this Charm, regardless of what Ability she uses to resist. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) successes on her opposed roll or adds (higher of Essence or 3) to the targeted static value. If the Shaping effect is rolled, its 1s subtract successes. Even if the Abyssal fails, she can pay one Willpower to mitigate the consequences. If a transformation is normally permanent, it becomes possible for the Abyssal to break it, though it’s up to her to figure out how — often with the use of Lore, Medicine, or Occult. The Abyssal also can’t be changed in a way that kills her, leaves her unable to take any actions, or stops her from using Charms or other magic at all — at least, not immediately. The Storyteller can inflict a weakened version of the effect that develops progressively, giving the Abyssal ample time to find a way to break it, as above — seasons, or even years. Alternatively, the Storyteller can alter the transformation’s nature so that it doesn’t have such an impact on the deathknight. With an Integrity 5, Essence 2 repurchase, Immutable Graven Mythos’s bonus becomes non-Charm. Against Shaping effects that are normally unrolled, the Abyssal rolls (Essence + current temporary Willpower) against the opposing character’s (current temporary Willpower). That character loses one success and one Willpower for each 1 or 2 that he rolls. Success negates that effect and renders the Abyssal immune to it for the rest of the session. If the Shaping isn’t created by a character, the Storyteller sets a difficulty for the Abyssal’s roll. Whispers: The Abyssal can invoke her Whispers instead of paying the Willpower cost to mitigate a Shaping effect’s consequences. "

When the Abyssal uses Heart-Haunting Condemnation, she can commit its cost indefinitely, causing its curse to slowly spread to everything the offender cares about. When he uses a Tie to an individual to resist the haunting’s influence — either by raising his Resolve or in a Decision Point — the curse spreads to the subject of the Intimacy. If the original roll beats the new victim’s Resolve, they’re cursed with dire misfortunes and hauntings that makes clear that the offender is the cause of that character’s woes. For example, if a swindler draws upon his Intimacy of love for his wife to deny his victims restitution because their relationship rests on the opulent lifestyle he can afford her, his wife may be attacked as his victims converge on their home to retake his ill-gotten wealth. Any who die due to the curse linger as ghosts and haunt the offender as the cause of their misfortune. "

Familiarity: Criminals perceive the deathknight as a fellow criminal, viewing her as a potential accomplice to be recruited, a threat to their turf, or potentially as a member of their own organization. Menace: The Abyssal exudes terror. Criminals and those who are frequently victimized by criminals view her as a threat to be avoided — a serial killer, vigilante, or similar peril. Receptivity: The Abyssal adapts the bearing of one open to illicit business. Characters seeking to solicit illegal or seedy services perceive the Abyssal as the perfect procurer of whatever they wish to obtain, while those offering such services perceive her as a desirable customer. Vulnerability: The Abyssal chooses a specific crime. Characters intending to commit that crime will view her as their ideal victim — charlatans see her as a guileless rube, thieves as a wealthy and inattentive target, and so on. Only one of these attitudes can be active at a time, but the Abyssal can change between them reflexively. "

            "Description": "Death’s Lawgiver bends the Underworld to her will, as if it were no more than another nightmare of the Neverborn. The Abyssal can use this Charm to shape the Underworld to her will. She can only use it within the Underworld proper, not including shadowlands. She can shape an area that extends out to (Essence x5) miles from her. She can’t shape inhabited regions if their denizens don’t want her to. This shaping is an extended (Intelligence + Lore) action with a, requiring a separate use of this Charm for each interval.The goal number depends on the effect the Abyssal wishes to invoke. Once she reaches the goal number, she can continue the shaping with a new effect, resetting her successes to zero. The roll has a base difficulty of 5, subject to the following modifiers. For example, an Abyssal who uses this Charm in the Labyrinth would roll first at difficulty 3, then difficulty 4, difficulty 5, and so on. Each successful roll lets the Abyssal make one of the following alterations. Some require her to first lay groundwork with other alterations — most notably, erasing existing terrain features to make way for new lands. Erase Terrain (Goal Number 5): The Abyssal eliminates a major feature of the landscape — a river, a mountain, a fortress. It fades away gradually, leaving barren wasteland in its place. Using this in ritual and primal afterlives can’t override their fundamental nature; whatever remains will still be thematically appropriate to them. Manses and other supernatural features can’t be erased, but don’t prevent the Abyssal from shaping around them. Alter Terrain (Goal Number 10): Once the Abyssal has erased all terrain features, she can remake the land. She creates a new terrain feature, raising up a hill out of the earth, opening a lake, or growing a forest of living bone. She can also add natural resources to the land, like veins of precious metal or deposits of the ore used to forge soulsteel. Particularly drastic changes may require multiple uses of this effect — creating a mountain to rival the Underworld’s tallest would require one use to create a hill, another to expand it into a mountain, and further uses to make it even larger. When shaping a primal or ritual afterlife, anything she creates will manifest in a way that fits their themes, regardless of what she intends. Demesnes (Goal Number 20 or 30): After creating a terrain feature, the deathknight may transform it into an Abyssal demesne. This has a goal number of 20 for two-dot demesnes and 30 for four-dot demesnes.. Objects and Structures (Goal Number 3, 10, or 20): After creating natural resources, the Abyssal can shape them into mundane objects or structures suited to the landscape she’s created. She could raise a funereal citadel from a mountain’s stone or shape veins of precious metal into jewelry for a reshaped necropolis’ ghostly populace. The goal number depends on the type of project that would be necessary to create the object: 3 for basic, 10 for major, and 20 for superior. Such creations often appear eerie, uncanny, or disturbing. Soulsteel (Goal Number 30): After creating the necessary ore, the Abyssal can shape it into soulsteel by binding ghosts within it. These unfortunate shades must either be willing or helpless. Creating enough soulsteel for an artifact weapon or armor requires at least five ghosts, or a single powerful shade. Creating enough soulsteel for multiple such artifacts or larger artifacts like warstriders require an additional use of this Charm to expand the shaped soulsteel — potentially more than one, depending on the scope of the Abyssal’s ambitions. Each use requires more and more ghosts, up to as many as a hundred per interval. Monstrosities: The Abyssal populates the shaped region with a nightmarish horror, with traits like those created by Night-Horror Summons. The Abyssal can continue shaping for as long as she can pay this Charm’s cost. She can act freely while shaping, including in combat, but can’t take other extended actions. This Charm ends prematurely if the Abyssal fails a roll for it or is incapacitated. Shaping the Underworld risks stirring dark forces. If she rolls six 1s in a single interval, the Storyteller may declare that a formidable threat is drawn to her or that she faces a peril like an earthquake or sudden storm as the shaped terrain rebels against her. Each interval, the number of 1s needed to trigger this is reduced by one, minimum (Abyssal’s Essence). If the Abyssal rolls more 1s than necessary, she may face even greater perils, like an undead behemoth rising from the Labyrinth. Reset: Once per story. "

Omens manifest in the region, allowing characters to recognize something terrible is coming with a difficulty 3 ([Intelligence or Perception) + Occult) roll.

The afflicted region can be up to (Essence x 10) square miles. She blights the region with one of the mundane diseases she can use with Unsurpassed Plague Kiss, inflicting the following effects: • Those within the blighted region must roll to resist being infected by the chosen disease each day they spend within it. The disease can’t be fully cured without magically enhanced treatment, and is unusually contagious, gaining +1 virulence.. • The spiritual corruption inflict a −3 penalty on Stamina rolls. This subtracts successes instead of dice from rolls to resist disease. • Blight ravages the land: water takes on a foul, almost fungal quality, and mosquitos proliferate around it; the air grows stale and smells of sickness in enclosed spaces; wood grows punky and rotten far quicker than it should. Mass deaths resulting from disease are far more likely to form a shadowland than usual. The blight can be nullified by disinterring the bodies and giving them proper funerary rites. Uncovering this vulnerability typically requires Lore and Occult rolls or suitable magic — and even then, the bodies must be found, typically requiring use of Awareness, Investigation, or Survival.

She may suffer a penalty if the memories she seeks out are old or somehow obscured.

The Abyssal’s player should work out the specifics with the Storyteller, but they should involve altering how it affects the target, rather than reducing Willpower costs, mitigating penalties, or other mechanical effects. • Roll against a Fair Folk’s Resolve to enter its spiritual maw and wrest free the shards of someone’s psyche that it’s devoured.

If the Abyssal instills a Tie to a culture that’s now dead or that consists primarily of the undead, her target is immune only if he has an opposed Defining Tie. She also gains this benefit when instilling a Principle involving a custom or belief related to death or from a culture that’s either dead or undead. "

Upon purchasing this Charm, the Abyssal creates a persona or role, designing a separate set of Intimacies for it. It must have at least four Intimacies, including one Major and one Defining Intimacy. Her role can be wholly fictional, or an impersonation of a specific individual, in which case it has all of his Intimacies that the Abyssal knows of. Using this Charm lets the deathknight assume this role after a few hours spent playing the part, studying the role, attending to costuming, or the like. The role’s Intimacies fully replace her own, which are suppressed and treated as if she didn’t have them. While in a role, its Intimacies can be changed as usual, though the Abyssal gains +1 non-Charm Resolve against instill rolls that fundamentally contradict its character concept. Likewise, the Abyssal can’t voluntarily form such Intimacies. Any Intimacies gained by the role aren’t carried over to the Abyssal’s true Intimacies. Leaving the role requires another use of this Charm, which requires the deathknight so spend at least a few minutes mentally separating herself with the role. This Charm can be purchased up to (Essence) times to create multiple roles. "

An Abyssal without Hideous is suffused with deathly beauty: skin turns deathly pale or colors with rich vitality; hair darkens or pales; her lips and cheeks flushing with blood; etc. An Abyssal with Hideous decays into a grotesque horror: her eyes sink deeper into her skull; skin wither, desiccates, or rots away entirely; blood or bile drips from her eyes, mouth, or skin; the scent of death clings to her; etc. The Abyssal’s altered appearance adds (Essence) non-Charm dice on certain influence rolls. If she doesn’t have Hideous, she does so on persuade and bargain rolls to seduce others and instill rolls to create or strengthen Ties based on desire for the Abyssal.

Kindled in Darkness (Reflexive; Instant): While acting in accordance with death’s chivalry or one of his or the Abyssal’s negative Defining Intimacies, the apostle can use this blessing after a roll, rolling three additional non-Charm dice. This blessing can also be used after a roll against one of his static values, adding the successes from these dice to that value. Prophet of Despair (Supplemental; Instant): The apostle doubles 8s and ignores multiple target penalties on an influence roll to instill or leverage a negative Intimacy.

If the Tie is already Defining, her influence costs an additional Willpower for him to resist. • Against influence that leverages the instilled Intimacy, he must weaken another of his positive Ties to resist with Willpower, if he has any. Ties based on romantic or sexual desire must be weakened first. • If he voluntarily weakens a positive Tie, it can’t be strengthened by any means unless he pays two Willpower per level of intensity. • Once per day, when he voluntarily weakens another positive Tie in the Abyssal’s presence, she gains one Willpower. With an Essence 5 repurchase, the Abyssal may target multiple characters with this roll, paying a threemote  surcharge for each additional target. Reset: This Charm can only be used against a character once per story. "

If she doesn’t target a ship, the Storyteller can set a difficulty or let another character make an opposed roll, as appropriate. In naval combat, she can use this Charm as a special stratagem by paying an additional Momentum cost. As a special naval combat stratagem, the Abyssal captain attempts to trap her opponents’ vessel in one of the following hazards: Wailing Reef (3 Momentum): Jagged coral spires emerge, wreathed in moaning corpses. This can block harbors, prevent escapes, and so on. In naval combat, it deals two Hull damage and inflicts a −3 penalty on the opposing vessel’s next Naval Maneuver roll. Foul Tide (4 Momentum): The sea curdles into thick black blood. Ships caught in it suffer −1 Mobility and all liquids aboard the ship are befouled, turning to blood. In naval combat, success also forces the opposing ship to succeed on a special positioning stratagem to escape the morass before they may attempt any stratagems that require movement. This doesn’t generate any Momentum. Mists of Despair (2 Momentum): Phantasmagoric mist enshrouds the ship or area, causing those who breathe it to suffer haunting hallucinations. Those exposed to it must roll (Stamina + Resistance) or (Wits + Integrity) at difficulty 5 or suffer the effects of Major Madness (Exalted, p. 168) for as long as they remain in the mist. They must immediately make a Willpower roll against it, and do so again at the start of each subsequent scene. This costs one Willpower to resist for a scene. In naval combat, success afflicts the opposing captain with Madness, as above, without receiving another roll to resist. He suffers a −3 penalty on Naval Maneuver rolls for the rest of the scene. Hazards created with this Charm crumble or dissipate within a day, though they may leave traces for up to a season, such as blood clots washing ashore from a Foul Tide. In the Underworld, hazards may remain permanently at the Storyteller’s discretion. "

Heartache’s Needle (3m, 1wp; Withering-only) An enemy’s soak is halved against a withering attack with Heartache’s Needle. If it crashes him, his soak is halved until he recovers from crash. Perdition’s Chains (3m, 1wp; Decisive-only): The attack receives the benefits of Shadow-Pinning Strike (p. XX), embedding Perdition’s Chains in the victim’s shadow. It doesn’t vanish until the clinch ends. This isn’t compatible with Soul-Haunting Infiltration River of Tears (5m; Uniform): This blade flows around obstructions. Its attacks are unblockable and ignore cover, even full cover. If River of Tears is the last remaining blade, its attack becomes undodgeable as well. Thorn of Regret (4m; Decisive-only): On a successful decisive attack, this blade’s barbs bite deep into the wound, calling out to its kin. On her next attack against that target, the Abyssal may choose to strike with two of the Seven Edges instead of one. She loses this benefit if she doesn’t attack him by the end of her next turn. The Weeping Mother (4m; Decisive-only): On a successful decisive attack, the Weeping Mother inflicts a poison of the eyes that inflicts Damage 4i/round, Duration (Essence + 3) rounds, and a −3 penalty. The venom drips from the victim’s eyes like black ichor, causing its penalty to subtract successes instead of dice from vision-based Perception and Awareness rolls. If the deathknight successfully establishes concealment against all enemies, she may call back one of her expended blades. Reset: Once per scene."

Cadaver-Beast Thews: The familiar adds (Abyssal’s Essence) automatic successes on feats of strength and adds her Essence to its effective Strength to determine what feats it can attempt. If it has Legendary Size, it adds (Essence x2) to its effective Strength instead. Corpse-Hide Resilience: The familiar gains +1 soak for each purchase of this boon it has. Dread Predator Alacrity: The familiar adds (Abyssal’s Essence) automatic successes on movement actions.

With an Essence 4 repurchase, the Abyssal may grant her familiar Legendary Size (p. XX), unless it had the Tiny Creature or Minuscule Size merits.

Similarly, the frozen downpour may destroy small structures made of wood or similar materials, while even the largest and sturdiest structures are badly damaged. • Those caught in the storm suffer a –3 penalty on movement actions and on all vision- and hearing-based rolls. This penalty subtracts successes instead of dice from Perception rolls. • Exposed crops are destroyed and soil is rimed with permafrost, making it impossible to sow new crops for the rest of the story barring magical intervention. • Bodies of water freeze solid. They won’t thaw until the end of the story, though significant efforts or powerful magic can break up or melt the ice. • If a character uses weather-altering magic against the storm, 1s and 2s on his opposed roll subtract successes.

The Abyssal desecrates a wilderness region, claiming it for the dead. It must be a single contiguous locale, like a forest, a bayou, or a mountain, but there’s no hard limit on how large a domain she can claim, save for the Storyteller’s discretion. She must spend at least a day traveling the entirety of the region, sowing teeth, bone-shards, and blighted seeds in the land. If the chosen region is inhabited, any mortal or ghostly communities in the area must be made to either accept her presence or recognize that they cannot drive her away. If any supernatural beings occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Abyssal must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. However, ghosts only count for this if their Essence equals or exceeds the Abyssal’s. Claiming a domain imposes the following effects: • The undead add (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) automatic successes on Survival rolls and rolls to resist the domain’s mundane environmental hazards. They count as having a Minor Tie of obedience to the Abyssal. • The living can’t regain Willpower from sleep within the domain. They subtract (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) successes from Survival rolls and rolls to resist mundane environmental hazards as the land rejects them. They count as having a Minor Tie of fear to the Abyssal. Wild animals don’t suffer these effects and count as having a Minor Tie of obedience to the Abyssal • Sunlight has no deleterious effects on the undead or things of the Underworld. It is always considered night for purposes of shadowlands and similar phenomena associated with death. • Wild animals that die within the domain are reanimated as undead horrors (p. XX). • Over the course of the story, a shadowland forms in the domain’s heart — the part of it that’s furthest from any towns, habitations, or similar developed areas. It spreads up to (Essence x10) miles outward from the heart, assuming no developed areas impede its spread. The shadowland opens into the nearest equivalent locale within the Underworld, often a primal afterlife related to death by wild animals, poisonous plants, or the like. The Abyssal can use Dark Roads of the Dead to travel to this shadowland without needing a roll. • If she uses Bleak Marches Wisdom for her domain, she doubles 7s on the roll and completes it instantly, without needing to scout in advance. An Abyssal can only have one such domain at a time. If she dies, it endures beyond her death, though it may then be possible to break it with curse-breaking magic or a sorcerous working at the Storyteller’s discretion. Special activation rules: When the Abyssal uses Nightmare-Carving Murmur (p. XX) to reshape land into a wilderness, she can use this Charm reflexively to claim that territory as her domain."

The Abyssal doesn’t need to aim to attack enemies at medium range or beyond. Against enemies with Initiative lower than the Abyssal’s and trivial enemies, these attacks are ambushes (Exalted, p. 203). Otherwise, they’re surprise attacks. The deathknight divides her Initiative evenly, rounded up, among all hit opponents to determine the damage rolled against them, ignoring Hardness. Trivial opponents suffer her full Initiative in damage, and aren’t included in the division. Once the attacks are completed, as long as any of them hit a nontrivial opponent, the Abyssal’s Initiative resets.

The Abyssal spends a scene commending a battle group whose members all have Ties from Loyal Unto Death, praising their martial prowess, faithful service, or red-handed deeds. (Mindless battle groups can’t benefit from such praise.) As long as the battle group’s members maintain their Ties, it gains the following benefits in combat: • +1 base Initiative. • +1 Resolve. This increases to +2 Resolve against fear-based influence or influence opposed by their Ties of loyalty. • The Abyssal’s command actions treat the battle group’s Drill as one step higher to determine how it affects the roll (Exalted, p. 207). If it already has elite Drill, the dice added are converted to non-Charm successes. • It’s immune to penalties from fatigue and deprivation. • Its rout checks don’t suffer increased difficulty from allied battle groups or leaders being defeated. The Abyssal may stack the Charm to enhance up to (Essence) battle groups. Special activation rules: This Charm’s Willpower cost is waived if the Abyssal uses it to conclude Hardened Killer Training Style’s regimen. "

The Abyssal extends tendrils of thought to any number of allied battle groups within long range, mentally linking herself to her forces. She gains the following benefits: • She can communicate with her forces and make command actions mentally, potentially negating penalties due to her forces being unable to her commands. Her communications can’t be intercepted without magic specifically suited to this purpose. • She can include a command action targeting a linked battle group in a flurry. This won’t let her flurry an order action with an attack. • Linked battle groups are unaffected by the Demoralized stratagem or magic that would cause them to betray the Abyssal in mid-battle, like First-in-School Assumption (Lunars, p. 225). If the Abyssal is incapacitated, all linked battle groups must make a difficulty 1 rout check as this connection is severed. This Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes if the Abyssal only assumes control of undead battle groups and battle groups that benefit from Acclaimed Company of Sinners. "

The Abyssal can use a rally for numbers action to restore Magnitude to a mindless undead battle group despite its perfect morale, adding (Essence) successes and ignoring the once-per-scene limitation on that action. If there are not any allied zombie battle groups, the Abyssal can instead animate a Size 1 battle group of zombies (Exalted, p. 502) with poor Drill and Might 1 as long as she rolls a single success. With 5+ successes and sufficient corpses to draw from, she instead reanimates a Size 2 zombie battle group. The deathknight draws her new recruits from corpses strewn across the battlefield, and there must be a sufficient supply of them for her to use this Charm. This requirement is generally satisfied in any combat where a battle group has suffered Magnitude damage, but the Storyteller may require the Abyssal and her allies to kill additional victims before she can use this Charm if he deems there aren’t enough available.

The Abyssal makes a Strategic Maneuver roll with double 7s to enact a unique magical stratagem with threshold 4. Enacting the stratagem causes a shadowland to open across the battlefield as combat begins, and also carries the effect of a Demoralized stratagem. If the Abyssal’s forces are already fighting in a shadowland or the Underworld, this stratagem instead enhances allied undead battle groups. The bonus dice their Might adds on attack rolls are converted to automatic successes, and they add their Might to their Size when determining their Magnitude (Exalted, p. 208). This shadowland doesn’t always linger after the battle’s end, but using this Charms make it far more likely that the fight will result in a permanent shadowland forming. Special activation rules: When the Abyssal uses Peerless Immortal Strategist, she may use this Charm reflexively, waiving its Willpower cost, to add its stratagem to her options. Reset: Once per story unless reset by unless reset by accomplishing a major character or story goal through warfare. "

The deathknight spends a scene commending a favored soldier, giving him a symbol or token of her favor: the insignia of his new rank, a ceremonial sword, one of the Company of Martial Sinners’ masks, etc. He must have a Tie from Loyal Unto Death at Defining intensity. So long as he keeps that Defining Tie and bears the Abyssal’s gift, he gains the following benefits: • +1 Resolve. This increases to +2 Resolve against fear-based influence or influence opposed by his Tie of loyalty. • Other characters with Ties to the Abyssal from Loyal Unto Death apply those Ties to him as well. • Once per day, he can add (Abyssal’s Essence/2, rounded up) successes on a War roll or threaten roll. • The Abyssal’s gift is nigh-indestructible, like an artifact. The Abyssal can stack this Charm to promote up to (Essence x2) characters. Uses past the first cost one mote, one Willpower. With War 5, Essence 4, lieutenants favored with this Charm can act in the Abyssal’s stead for Acclaimed Company of Sinners and Hardened Killer Training Style, letting her pay a one-Willpower surcharge to use those Charms from afar when her lieutenants commend or train troops.

The Abyssal opens a lasting mental link with an allied battle group within long range. All of its members have a Tie of loyalty to her. This has the effects of Hive-Mind Horror Tactics (p. XX), as well as the following: • The battle group’s members cannot disobey the Abyssal when she makes her will known, subject only to the limits of unacceptable influence. • The battle group gains perfect morale (Exalted, p. 210). If it already had it, it gains +1 Might instead. • The Abyssal can reflexively tap into the senses of the battle group’s members. She can make rolls with Awareness, Investigation, and Survival through the group’s perspective, adding (Size) dice, and can enhance them with magic as usual. While sharing the battle group’s senses, the Abyssal can’t use her own. • When the battle group enters combat, the deathknight Joins Battle even if she isn’t present, rolling (Wits + War) with (Essence) successes. The battle group uses her successes if they’re higher than its own. The only actions she can take are command actions targeting the linked group and using War Charms. This link remains open regardless of the distance between the Abyssal and controlled battle group. This Charm’s cost is reduced by two motes on undead battle groups and battle groups that benefit from Acclaimed Company of Sinners. Reset: Once per story."
