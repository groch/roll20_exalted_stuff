If she knows Enfolded in the Dragon’s Wings (p. 282), she may likewise spare allied characters. The hazard has difficulty (the Dragon-Blood’s Intelligence), but doesn’t have a standard damage.

Any character wearing metal armor, including armor made from the magical materials, applies its mobility penalty on his roll to resist the hazard. The damage roll benefits  from double 9s. Earth: The earth rumbles in a mighty earthquake, scattering stone debris skyward to strike flying foes. A character that takes 3+ levels of damage falls into a chasm and lands prone, suffering damage as per a short-range fall (Exalted, p. 232). Climbing out of the chasm counts as moving through difficult terrain (Exalted, p. 199). Fire: A pyroclasm sweeps across the battlefield, igniting  anything flammable. As long as there’s fuel, even after the vortex fades, it leaves behind a hazard with difficulty 5, Damage 4L/round within its range, which burns for at least (Intelligence) hours. These flames won’t burn the Dragon-Blood or any allies spared from the vortex. Water: A standing wave towers above the Dragon- Blood before collapsing outward in all directions with tsunami force. For every three levels of damage a character suffers from the hazard, rounded up, he’s knocked back one range band from the Dragon-Blood to fall prone, and suffers an additional three dice of bashing damage, ignoring Hardness.

The expended Aura must be of an element that hasn’t already been expended; each participating Dragon- Blood must contribute a unique element to the vortex.

This Charm is a dramatic action to prepare for an upcoming battle by rounding up a herd of horses or other wild, ridable animals — even blundering yeddim. This is a series of (Charisma + Ride) rolls, which are treated as rally for numbers actions (Exalted, p. 209), building up the Magnitude of animals that the Dragon-Blood has gathered. Each roll takes five minutes of animal calls, handling, or impressive stunts to complete. Once the Dragon-Blood has built up enough Magnitude to form a Size 1 battle group, she may continue making rally rolls to increase the group’s Size, up to a maximum of Size 3. Concealing the approach of this stampeding herd is impossible without large-scale magic. The herd isn’t treated as a battle group in combat. Instead, when the Dragon-Blood rolls Join Battle, it stampedes across the battlefield, imposing a penalty equal to (its Size) on all enemy Join Battle rolls, before dispersing. Every enemy whose Join Battle roll is beaten  by the Dragon-Blood’s takes decisive damage as the stampede tramples over them. She divides (Initiative + stampede’s Size) dice of bashing damage evenly among the victims (round up), ignoring Hardness. Trivial opponents  and battle groups instead take the full (Initiative + Size) damage roll, which doesn’t detract from the total divided among other enemies. This attack resets the Dragon-Blood to base Initiative once it’s completed. The Dragon-Blood may learn elemental variants of this Charm for three experience points each. While she’s in appropriate terrain, she may rouse that element’s natural perils instead of wild animals. She still rolls to build up its effective Size for determining the Join Battle penalty and total damage inflicted, but this represents  the force of nature that follows her, growing stronger as she rides. Air: Riding through snow-covered land, the Dragon- Blood trails an avalanche behind her. Any enemy that takes decisive damage on the initial roll is hurled one range band away from the Dragon-Blood and falls prone. The numbing cold imposes a penalty equal to the avalanche’s Size on all movement rolls a damaged character makes until he receives medical treatment as a difficulty 3 (Intelligence + Medicine) roll. Earth: Charging across mountainsides or stony terrain, the Dragon-Blood unleashes a rockslide that follows in her wake. Any enemy that takes decisive damage on the initial roll is hurled one range band away from the Dragon-Blood and falls prone, covered in rubble. A buried character or one of his allies must succeed on a Strength 3 feat of strength at difficulty 3 to clear the rubble before he can attempt to rise from prone. Fire: Riding over dry grass or other parched foliage, the Dragon-Blood ignites a roaring grass fire that follows  in her wake. A bonfire (4L/round, difficulty 5) ignites  at the feet of each enemy that that takes decisive damage from the initial roll. At the Storyteller’s discretion , flammable scenery may also catch fire as long as no character is present in the same space. These fires burn until the end of the scene unless put out. Water: The Dragon-Blood may ride with a river, coastline, or similar body of water at her back, running along the riverbed until the river runs with her. As she Joins Battle, it changes its course to spill over onto the battlefield, positioned by the Storyteller to benefit the Dragon-Blooded. Its largest dimension is at least (Size/2, rounded up) range bands long, from a starting point determined by the Storyteller.

Success suppresses the chosen memory, allowing the Dragon-Blood to interact with her victim for a single scene as though it never happened. The victim cannot bring it up or even remember it, rationalizing away any inconsistencies  this causes.

However, he’s unaware she caused his memory lapse. A Socialize 5, Essence 5 repurchase allows the Dragon- Blood to expend her Water Aura to permanently erase the targeted memory with this Charm. The penalty for erasing egregious misdeeds subtracts successes instead of dice. The victim may still resist, as above, but doing so only restores the memory for a single scene.

To use this Charm, the Dragon- Blood must have Initiative 12+. She makes a decisive attack that detonates on impact, adding (Essence) dice of damage and rolling an additional die of damage for every 9 and 10 on the damage roll. Artifact weapons suffer no damage from being used with this Charm, but most mundane weapons are destroyed. An Essence 5+ repurchase unlocks two additional effects that can be used in conjunction with other Charms. Exploding Armor Strike: When the Dragon-Blooded lands a decisive attack enhanced by this Charm against an enemy whose armor has been weakened by Armor- Piercing Fang (p. 275), she can detonate the embedded weapons for five motes each, adding three bonus dice of damage for each additional explosion. Rain of Falling Stars: When the Dragon-Blooded uses Thousand Razor Wind, she may reflexively activate Exploding Weapon Technique as a Balanced Charm without needing to be in Fire Aura. Instead of this Charm’s usual effect, the first attack that hits detonates, adding three dice of decisive damage. She may detonate any subsequent attacks that hit for five motes each, with the same effect.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"thrown":5,"essence":3},"prereq":[],"charm-skill":"Thrown","charm-name":"Fatal Riptide Strike","charm-type":"Supplemental","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"5m","rep-cost-mote":5,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"DB Core","charm-aspect":"water","charm-mute":1,"charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Uniform","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Dragon-Blood’s anima limns her hands and weaponry  with aqueous Essence, allowing them to move through water as though it were air.

The ground out to close range from an enemy battle group becomes difficult terrain, and the battle group acts last on the first turn regardless of its place in Initiative order. The point cost is the Size of the battle group targeted. Barricade (4 point): The Dragon-Blood wrenches up great masses of earth and compresses them into barriers or walls, instantly enacting a Fortifications stratagem (Exalted, p. 212). Sapping (7 points): If an enemy general has successfully  employed a Fortifications stratagem, the Dragon- Blood may negate its benefits by tunneling through earth and stone, or otherwise creating ways to bypass the fortifications. The Dragon-Blood’s forces don’t treat the terrain as difficult, and may reflexively advance  one range band towards the enemy forces. The Storyteller may also adjudicate additional advantages depending on the context of the battlefield. Reshape Battlefield (10 points): If the Dragon-Blood has successfully enacted a Strategic Placement stratagem (Exalted, p. 212), she may resculpt the battlefield to her specifications, preparing it before the battle and ensuring her enemy will fight her there. She might prepare rows of trenches and fortified towers of earth for her own forces, while forcing her enemy to traverse pits filled with stone spikes, narrow stone tunnels, and similar obstacles.
