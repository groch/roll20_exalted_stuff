If another character uses magic to act first on the same round, compare their Initiative to determine order of actions. The Initiative roll on this gambit is made with double 9s.

If she misses or forces her target to lose a turn, the Charm ends. As with the previous upgrade, waive the willpower cost from all but the first shot. If the Solar stops an opponent from acting, award her a point of Willpower. As above, for every two shots the opponent is delayed, he’s forced back a range band.

The Solar may use this Charm to clash attacks against her from short or close range, but only when she is in her -4 health levels. This clash gains (Essence) automatic successes, and the damage roll doubles 9s. However, Initiative damaged by this roll is not transferred  to the Solar; it is instead rerolled as decisive damage against her target, ignoring hardness and doubling 10s. An Essence 5+ repurchase of this Charm removes the Perilous  keyword, allowing the Solar to spend herself into lower negative Initiative numbers while crashed. "

Motes returned in this fashion may retroactively lower the cost committed to Awareness Charms of a scene or longer duration, both lowering the committed cost and returning the discounted  mote(s) to the Solar’s mote pool. Second: her senses function even when she is asleep or Incapacitated, allowing  her to use any of her Awareness Charms subconsciously . A threat revealed to the Solar while she is asleep or unconscious automatically revives her, allowing her to defend herself. "

This Charm represents an array of mechanical benefits, as well as two distinct functions of the senses taste and smell. The Solar can recognize an individual by scent alone, and she can tell older scents from new ones, enabling  her to tell how recently an individual was present. Add +2 successes to Survival rolls to hunt for food, track a character, or find water, using her sense of smell. This Charm automatically extends the range of these actions to (Essence * 200) yards. This Charm also creates a library of scents which your character can reference. Upon learning this Charm, the library is populated with the scents of any Major or Defining  Intimacy the character may have, but it can also include scents outside the confines of intimacies if the Storyteller deems them reasonable, including any scent the character has encountered in the last 24 hours, the smell of a favorite food or drink, or scents linked to strong memories such as love or pain. Entries in a Solar’s scent library can be used to aid in Investigation and Survival rolls, as well as in the smell-based Awareness Charms further up the tree. This Charm also creates a taste index. Similar to the scent library, the taste index allows the Exalt to immediately recognize any taste she has experienced within the realm of reason. The Solar can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced  most of the flavors at some point in time. The taste index isn’t populated the same way as the scent library; most characters do not have Major or Defining intimacies for flavors. Rather, the Solar may perfectly recognize any flavor the Storyteller considers reasonable. If the charac- ter has been a master chef all of her life, her palate is going to be considerably more robust than that of an islander with little contact with the outside world. Conversely, those who have lived or traveled in remote locations may have had access to rare and exotic food, drink, and poison.

For any unknown, she can further make generally accurate discernments  about what kind of being each scent belongs to. Beasts, for example, smell different than humans, as do the undead and spirits. If a scent is not in her library, she can still form a general idea about the creature it belongs to.

For many actions that would require success on a roll at difficulty  2, the Solar can succeed without a roll. For more difficult actions, the difficulty is lowered by 1, and the Solar gains one automatic success. If she has a specialty that can be logically applied to the roll, the difficulty drops to 1. For example, a Solar who is unfamiliar with art crime will find it more difficult to identify a faked painting by touch than a Solar with an Investigation specialty in detecting  forgeries.

The Solar can track her prey’s scent with the unerring accuracy  of a bloodhound, or find her victim’s scent with the methodical  sipping of a serpent. The Exalt adds her Perception  or a minimum of 2 automatic successes to any Survival-based rolls to track a character or hunt for food or water using her sense of smell, and extends her range for doing so to (half her Essence rounded up) miles. She also gains the ability to scent moods, making an automatically  successful scent-based read intentions action to determine  a target’s disposition. She can add scentless, tasteless subjects to her scent library and taste index. She can also add items to her taste index by merely smelling them, as well as reference those tastes by smell alone. With a harmless drop on her tongue, she can identify a poison she has tasted, and she can detect a tasteless  poison by the way it dilutes a drink or acts as an unknown ingredient in a meal whose flavors are well known to her. In addition, bleeding characters (those with a wound penalty of -1 or greater) and characters who are severely injured (-4 wound penalty) are easier to find. Add 1 or 2 dice to an Awareness roll against the target’s Stealth. This Charm follows the special activation rules of Unsurpassed Sight Discipline (p. 271), discounting the cost of taste and smell effects instead of those which enhance sight. "

She can hear a thunderstorm burgeoning, an army decamping, a tyrant lizard roaring, and other loud noises at (Essence * 5) miles. She can read by passing her fingers over a page and feeling the ink beneath her fingertips. This Charm also confers the following  techniques to the Solar: Conjure Image: For one mote, the Exalt can visualize an object she is touching, in sections no larger than a horse’s head. She can identify a familiar face in a pitch black crypt, but might need several activations to visualize  the fossil skeleton of an ancient behemoth in a lightless  cavern. Sense Current: For one mote, the Exalt can feel the lightest  motion of air, orienting herself to the exit in even the most lightless of conditions. Read the Web: For five motes committed, the Exalt can listen in on a conversation behind a thick door, just by touching a connecting wall or surface. She feels the vibrations  in her fingertips, and her senses translate them to words she can hear. This is a scene length effect, and its range can be extended up to (Essence x100) yards by running a wire from the Exalt’s fingertips into a chamber where her targets are speaking. Sound from Stillness Meditation: For six motes, one Willpower, the Solar can take a Simple action lasting five minutes to filter Creation, listening for specific sounds or conversations that have already happened. The Exalt draws audio from the vibrations of sounds stored in her surroundings —usually rocks and trees—and may listen for noises or conversations that happened up to (Essence x5) hours prior to her arrival with a difficulty 5 Awareness roll. For the duration of the technique, the Solar must remain still, listening intently as she filters out the garbled static and unwanted sounds to reach the reverberations she’s search- ing for. As this technique only lasts five minutes, the Solar can only glean up to half that amount in useful audio. Unsurpassed Hearing and Touch follows the special activation  rules of Unsurpassed Sight Discipline (p. 271), discounting the cost of hearing and touch effects instead of those which enhance sight. This Charm can never discount  the cost of its own techniques. "

Eyes blazing white, Caste Mark burning, her gaze shines a wide beam of light across everything she searches, twin lamps moving over the terrain out to long range. Everything caught in her stare is subject to the following effects: • All magical and mundane Stealth effects are cancelled. Solid walls and other opaque objects grow transparent as the Lawgiver’s gaze passes over them, rendering all forms of Stealth automatically unsuccessful. • Fog lifts, smoke parts, and clouds dissolve under the Solar’s intense focus. • Dematerialized spirits are forced to materialize, at full cost of the Materialize Charm, or as much of the cost as they can pay. • All disguise magic is stripped. Mundane disguises tatter and melt away. • Shapeshifters are forced back into natural form, resplendent  destinies are temporarily forced into dormancy, personas (p. 400) are suppressed, and other innate or native transformative magics of the Exalted are similarly  deactivated. The only way to avoid Eye of the Unconquered Sun is to successfully dodge the Solar’s gaze by applying Evasion against the Solar’s Awareness roll. The Solar’s Awareness roll is enhanced by (Essence) dice, and any 1s rolled are rerolled until 1s fail to appear. Every character within long range of the Solar who fails to dodge when she uses Eye of the Unconquered Sun is subject to the above effects. The range of this Charm is extended to extreme range by Unsurpassed Sight Discipline, however, this Charm does not depend on eyesight and may be learned and employed by a blind Exalt. Anyone spotted by Eye of the Unconquered  Sun automatically knows it; a bright white glare piercing through a fortress wall or an airship hull is impossible  to miss. "

If the damage roll generates  at least one success, the target is knocked prone by the force of the blow, and loses a point of Initiative, which is added to the Solar’s base value (typically 3) when her Initiative resets. This blow strikes with the force of a hurricane  condensed into the Solar’s fist. The more damaging  the blow, the more forcefully her opponent will be knocked away from her: For at least three successes, the opponent is lifted and bodily hurled into an object or surface within close range, hitting it with an impact equivalent to falling a short distance (see falling damage, p. 232), destroying any less-obdurate objects he collides with, such as wooden furniture. At four or more successes, the foe is knocked into an object at close range with tremendous force, or is sent sailing a remarkable distance by the force of the blow. If the former, the opponent hits a surface with force sufficient to leave cracks in a stone wall, impacting with a surface as if he had fallen from a medium distance. If the latter, the force of the blow throws him to short range with a short-distance  falling impact. At five or more successes, the foe is thrown to short range and suffers an impact like falling from a medium height. The Solar can use Heaven Thunder Hammer to knock her opponent into a high ceiling, forcing him to contend with falling damage on the way down. She might also choose to smash him through a weak point in a nearby wall, causing him to suffer a collapse. She might aim to hurl her opponent into a spike protruding from a surface, turning the damage lethal, or knock her enemy from a rooftop, causing him to suffer a fall from a much greater distance. The player should include the environment in their stunts to enhance this Charm’s effectiveness. At Essence 3+, double the successes for determining the distance the victim is hurled. At 7+, the victim can be hurled to medium range with a medium height impact. "

For example, a Strength 3, Athletics 3 character who is properly  motivated could use this Charm to dash a heavy iron lock from a coffer with the heel of her boot, where a simpler feat might involve a brawler who draws her fist along the cobbles of a street or the stones of a wall, pulping the stony surface into a fine sand to blind her opponent with a punch. Using Sledgehammer Fist Punch in such a way may be done reflexively (though the character can still only take a reasonable number of such reflexive actions per round, at the Storyteller’s discretion), but using it to cause harm indirectly (by e.g. collapsing a pillar or kicking a stack of barrels down onto someone) requires that it supplement a combat action.

Through Divine Mantle, the Lawgiver can further embody the Principles most central to her character by temporarily  learning the Charms of spirits that represent the Principles  the Solar has embodied. However, the Exalt may only take Charms from spirits whose nature match one of her Defining Principles, and may only take one spirit Charm for every six Solar Ability Charms she knows which match both the spirit’s nature and the Defining Principle in question. Thus, the more strongly she embodies  a certain Principle, the more Charms she can take from the god in question. The Storyteller  can pick from published spirits or can make up appropriate  Charms on the spot for the purposes of this Charm. The Exalt may take up the Charms of multiple different spirits simultaneously , but she may have no more than ten spirit Charms through Divine Mantle. However, if the grounding Principle  is lowered in intensity or destroyed, or if any being successfully impugns her embodiment of said Principle by usurping her authority, defeating her, or destroying or harming the subject of her Principle, then she loses her ability to perform the greater miracles of the spirit’s office until she has taken actions to undo the harm or restore her damaged Principle. If the Solar wishes to change which spirit Charms she is using, she must spend one hour per Charm meditating on the target Principle. This allows her to move up or down the spirit’s Charm trees as needed. She can also swap (Essence or three, whichever is greater) Charms through one use of Mind-Cleansing Prana.

This Charm can momentarily restore evidence no larger than that which the Exalt can normally lift and carry, but it allows her a full examination of the destroyed object. Once her examination of the restored object has concluded, her commitment is dropped and the Essence of the object disperses. "

She is a creature  of the criminal element; duplicity is in her every word and step. This Charm allows the Solar to invoke and discard a number of special distinctions at her leisure, which allow her to gather information, infiltrate criminal society, and protect her position there. The distinctions are as follows: Familiarity: To a member of a criminal organization, she seems familiar—that is, she can play on a Minor Intimacy to make her target believe she is a criminal with whom to be treated: a member of the organization, a prospect for initiation, etc. Dissonance: Magistrates or other officials seeking to establish  her identity suffer a -2 penalty to their Bureaucracy  and Investigation actions. Persons who do not know her personally but may have spotted her or seen her hanging around the scene of a crime find her unrecognizable  and cannot remember doing so. Vulnerability: The Exalt makes herself seem the best possible target for a type of crime dictated by the player. Confidence men will see her as an easy mark, gamblers will seek to engage her with betting gossip or games of chance, thugs will try to mug her, and so forth. This effect has a visual component: thieves are less likely to steal from an Exalt wearing armor and a battle axe, while a serial killer might find a person who wears her hair a certain way irresistible. Receptivity: Similar to vulnerability, interested parties perceive the Exalt as a local player. Rather than prey on her directly, she may be identified as a drug buyer or seller, or a person looking to make a bet, hire a prostitute, or take part in other illicit or seedy activities. Such parties will be interested in providing her with information about where to go and who to talk to. "

She may change her gender, double her age or halve it, alter her height by ten inches in either direction, change her ethnicity, adjust her voice and alter her accent. She can even change her scent. The Solar gains two automatic successes to her disguise attempt, ignores penalties for adapting a different race or gender, and gains double 9s. This disguise cannot be pierced by mundane senses. Nor can it be thwarted by inhuman sensory acuity, such as the nose of a hound or the eye of a hawk. Senses heightened to supernatural levels by Charms such as Keen Sight Discipline  have a chance to pierce this deception, but subtract  2 successes from their attempts. Magic which pierces this effect does not reveal the Solar’s identity, only that the Exalt is not what she appears to be. Typically Solars used this Charm to hide their identities or to appeal to specific criteria such as “Only women are allowed into the sept.” However, should it be used to impersonate  a specific character, magic which pierces this effect will only reveal the apparent body double of the Charm’s subject. For example, if the Solar disguises herself as the Scarlet Empress, magic which pierces her disguise will see her as a tall, porcelain-skinned red-haired woman with cunningly accurate makeup, as opposed to what the Solar actually looks like.

Even so, a witness using Charms or other magic to penetrate the disguise suffer a -4 dice penalty to do so. In addition, should he fail at this attempt, his next attempt suffers an additional  -1. This penalty cannot exceed -5. In addition to these effects, the Exalt may adapt Essencebased  visual dynamics not covered by simple makeup or disguise. Her hair might stand on end and crackle with lightning; she might hover inches off the ground or display the anima of a different kind of Exalt. None of these displays  are real. That is, displaying a Fire Aspect’s anima will not actually burn anything, though witnesses will feel the intensity of its heat. She may appear to float, but her feet are still touching the ground. "

Doing so carries no Defense penalty. • The Lawgiver’s Initiative roll gains double 9s. On a success, the Exalt steals her target’s weapon.

Gathering all the speed and skill of her hands into the channel of her Essence, her talent is forced out through her skin, manifesting in a burning corona that coats her hands in the fires of her anima. For a moment, the gloves suffuse her hands and blaze. For the next thirty seconds or two rounds, whichever comes first, no member of a criminal organization nor creature of darkness may Join Battle against the Lawgiver or roll to attack her. During this time, each of her allies gains +3 automatic successes to any attempt to escape the scene. After this effect ends, her hands continue to blaze. She may mute the effect with just a thought: her Null Anima Gloves fade to invisibility. They are still there, however. Should she use her hands to block an attack, land a strike, or steal an object, they will flash and hum back into existence , and remain that way until she banishes them. This is merely a visual display, however… Null Anima Gloves convey the following powers: • Raiton’s Unerring Claw: Once per full anima progression , she may reroll any Larceny-based action involving her hands. • Flashing Whip, Silent Whip: Once per day, she may use a free full Larceny Excellency to enhance an attempt to pickpocket or steal from plain sight. • Seize the Day: In combat, she may use a gambit which costs three Initiative to make a (Dexterity + Larceny) based decisive attack against her opponent, with double successes on the Initiative roll. If she succeeds, she regains four Initiative and steals an additional amount from the opponent equal to her Dexterity, adding it to her own total. The Exalt must be close enough to touch her opponent to use this technique and must use her hands to make the attack. Seize the Day can only be used once per battle, but is automatically reset when the Solar climbs to 15+ Initiative after landing a decisive attack which returns her to base Initiative. • Dream-Ending Gesture: With a curt flash of her hand, the Solar rips away the proof of her foe’s divinity. The Exalt uses a gambit costing five Initiative, making a (Dexterity  + Larceny) based decisive attack against her opponent , with double successes on the Initiative roll. If the Exalt’s gambit succeeds, she steals a number of motes equal to her extra successes on the attack, adding them to her peripheral or personal motes. Dream-Ending Gesture can only be used once per scene. • Steal Inertia: Once per battle the Exalt may reflexively enact a (Dexterity + Larceny) Clash against an attack. This Clash is enhanced by (Essence) automatic successes . If her successes cancel her opponent’s, she can be seen to stop the blow with her blazing, anima-suffused hands, and may automatically respond with a disarm gambit at no cost, using extra successes on the Clash as automatic successes to her gambit’s Initiative roll. • Hand-Spear Convocation: Upon stealing an artifact, she experiences a rush of power that surges through her body and floods into her hands, supplying the motes needed to attune the artifact, effectively reducing the cost of attunement to 0. This may only happen once per scene. "

Like the prerequisite, the difficulty to pierce this deception is the Solar’s (Linguistics + Essence) score at the time of writing. Combining this Charm with its prerequisite raises that difficulty by one. Stolen Voice Technique’s deception is automatically successful unless the target has a reason to scrutinize the writing. "

Upon writing the message, roll (Manipulation + Linguistics) with (Essence) automatic successes to determine the strength of the deception  when compared to the target’s Resolve. To use this Charm, the Exalt must not sign the missive in question ; the unsigned letter invites the assumption that allows this Charm to take effect. The Exalt may use this technique in three different ways: She can make readers believe a message was written by a specific person of whom they’re aware—they do not need to know this character on a personal level. She can also make readers assume the letter was written by the person they most want the letter to be from. Lastly, if the Solar has Bureaucracy 3+, she can make readers assume the letter was written by a hierarchical superior. Despite being a Simple-type Charm, Moving the Unseen Hand can always be used in combination with its prerequisite ; failure to see through Stolen Voice Technique makes the character automatically subject to Moving the Unseen Hand’s deception.

This Charm is a mental attack disguised as social influence, entailing a written or spoken action made with (Manipulation + [Linguistics or another relevant Social Ability]). The Solar must target an Intimacy when using this Charm—exploiting something the character cares about to get him to accept influence. However, upon success, the target will feel overwhelmingly compelled to act in a way that is the opposite of what she agreed to, as if her Intimacy had been inverted. For example, a Solar convinces an Immaculate priest of the evils of the har- lotry in Great Forks, convincing her to shun the temple prostitutes. The priest agrees vehemently, and then goes to live with them. Likewise, a Solar forced to brainwash a Circle member could outwardly torture him, while actually  strengthening his Intimacies of love for her and his understanding of why his suffering  is necessary. Once successful, persuasion caused by this Charm can’t be resisted with Willpower until another character successfully  dissuades the target from a chosen course of action (p. 221), and upon doing so, the target must pay (Solar’s Essence) Willpower to break free. Intimacies tainted by this Charm are more insidious— they are both harder to root out, but also indecipherable from what a character truly believes. While Transcendent Hero’s Meditation (p. 308) can shatter persuasion caused by this Charm, it can’t change the Solar’s Intimacies, though it does make her realize how she’s been influenced. "

To activate this Charm, the Solar commits a number of experience points from her own unspent experience total. She may confer these experience points to another character  by delivering a lesson she has constructed, allowing her to train a character’s Attributes or Abilities up to a rating of 5, even if this puts the character beyond her own rating. However, for each three experience points the Solar spends on the character in question, that character must adopt, at the Minor level, an Intimacy the Solar holds. The Solar may choose which Intimacy is conferred. For each three experience points conferred, the Solar may confer individual Intimacies, or she may increase a single Intimacy’s intensity from Minor to Major, or from Major to Defining, so long as she holds that Intimacy at the Major or Defining level herself. Intimacies conferred in this manner cannot be decayed for any reason until the character  has performed at least one task equal to that Intimacy ’s intensity (p. 215). The Solar has sole discretion over who is able to benefit from the experience points on offer. Refer to training times on page 178 to determine how long each training session should take. At the end of each story, the Solar may roll a number of dice equal to experience points spent on this Charm, regaining a number of experience equal to her successes, but not beyond the total amount of experience she expended in training. A Solar with Socialize Charms related to the creation of personas may use this Charm while in the guise of a persona, but she must pay from both her main unspent experience total and the persona’s unspent experience total to do so. Lastly, the Solar cannot benefit from this or any other experience-granting training  Charm in the same story in which she uses it to benefit someone else. "

            "Description": "Affirming Blow, Truth-Rendering Gaze Of all the Chosen, the Solar Exalted alone have the power to stem the tides of chaos with their force of will. This Charm represents a Solar whose mind flows with a command of knowledge so potent it can reverse the decay of Creation. Channeling endless lore through unsurpassed Essence, the Solar stands at the edge of the world and forces shape into the howling teeth of the storm. System: Through use of this Charm, the Solar can fashion the raw forces of chaos into practically anything—so long as her mind is able to conceptualize the reality of her desire and force it to take shape. This Charm occurs in and depends on phases to accomplish such a feat. Wyld-Shaping  Technique consists of a dramatic action lasting about a minute, in which the Solar forces her will upon the Wyld, pays the cost of the Charm, and makes an (Intelligence + Lore) roll against a specified difficulty. Each time she succeeds  at this roll, a phase is completed. Some things can be shaped in a single phase. Others require that the Solar continue to use Wyld-Shaping Technique, phase after phase, in order to reach an appropriate phase on which to accomplish her goal. Each time she reaches a new phase and repays the cost of the Charm, her results from the previous  phase are dissolved and reshaped. Essentially, the Solar must shape and reshape the Wyld in order to create larger, more powerful, or more specific results. The base difficulty of using Wyld-Shaping Technique is 5. At each new phase, the difficulty increases by one. Therefore , at phase three the difficulty would be 7, and phase six would require overcoming a difficulty of 10. During each phase, the Solar must remain near the relative epicenter  of her shaping action. She can defend and attack, and she can move in response to her own environmental shaping, but she cannot engage in other extended actions such as sorcery. If she is incapacitated or fails the difficulty  roll, the consequences are severe. She loses the cost of her Charm, including any invested experience points, and the shaping action fails completely. Moreover, she will experience a backlash if she botches, provoking an immune response from the Wyld—whatever she was trying to shape will turn against her and try to strike her down. The higher the phase at which this occurs, the more powerful  the Wyld’s response will be. Considerations: In order to activate this Charm, the Solar must be standing at the absolute border of the middlemarches , facing the deep Wyld, or must otherwise be within the deep Wyld itself. Wyld-Shaping Technique requires  the pure, inchoate resonance of chaos to work; the bordermarches and middlemarches of Creation are too solid to shape. Therefore, the more complex or large a thing the Solar wishes to shape, the deeper into the deep Wyld she needs to go. It would suffice for her to shape a gold ingot at Creation’s rim, but to raise an island of Creation  from the Wyld, she would need to travel several miles into chaos. Use of Wyld-Shaping Technique automatically ends use of Chaos-Repelling Pattern in every direction around the Solar for three range bands. While the Exalt is employing this Charm, the Wyld is suborned by her supernal will. As with Chaos-Repelling Pattern, her immediate atmosphere will remain stable, and will adhere to the laws of physics for the Charm’s duration. Unlike Chaos-Repelling Pattern, the Lawgiver can be affected by body- and soul-shaping magic while working this Charm, unless she is under the aegis of Charms such as Integrity-Protecting Prana or Wyld-Dispelling Prana. As with Chaos-Repelling Pattern, the Solar can still be attacked by Wyld-spawned denizens while using Wyld-Shaping Technique. In fact, use of this Charm almost certainly guarantees that she will be. Encounter Roll: At the start of each phase, after the Charm’s cost has been paid but before the player has made the Charm’s roll, there is an encounter roll to determine whether the Solar is challenged by denizens of the Wyld. Roll a single die and add the Solar’s Essence to the result to determine the outcome. At each subsequent phase, remove 1 from the roll result. 8+: No encounter. 7: A small group (3-5) of weak enemies such as hobgoblins or pumpkin -men attacks. 6: A more powerful Fair Folk appears with a number of weaker minions. 5: A raksha hunting party (3-5 members) with a number of hunting beasts and minions appear. 4: As 5, but the force is slightly larger and led by a raksha noble. Alternately, a powerful Wyldspawned  monster appears. 3: A number of powerful Fair Folk (hannya, noble raksha or otherwise) or other Wyld denizens emerge. Alternately, multiple Wyld-spawned monsters emerge. 2: The Solar is swarmed by hundreds of weaker Fair Folk or other Wyld denizens, joined by a number of powerful fae creatures; alternately, a dozen monsters are shaped by the Wyld to go on the attack. 1-0: A behemoth stirs from its slumber to attack the Solar. Phases: The Solar must reach a certain phase of Wyld- Shaping Technique in order to raise substance from chaos. For example, if a shaping project must be completed on phase two, the phase is successfully completed after the Exalt succeeds at the Charm’s roll. Land: The Solar can create non-specific land much more easily than she can raise very specific tracts. It is much easier for her to call forth massive amounts of general land than it is for her to induct very specific geography, and smaller, more specific geography is much more difficult  than larger masses of land simply exuded from her formidable unconscious. For non-specific land, she can create (Essence x10) square miles of land in the first phase, and every successive phase multiplies this by three until phase eight. From phase eight and onward, each successive  phase adds (Essence x1000) square miles. Additionally, the Solar can spend extra successes in each phase to add ten square miles to the land’s area at a rate of two successes per ten square miles. After phase seven, the cost decreases to one success per one hundred square miles. With non-specific land, the climate, geography, wildlife, spirits, and sentient beings that exist there will correlate with the nearest Pole. Until phase three, no demesnes are guaranteed to form, though previously generated land can still be geomantically sculpted to produce demesnes. After phase three, non-specific land will generate at least one additional minor demesne each phase, and any non-specific  land created at phase six or beyond is guaranteed to have a number of major and minor demesnes. The Solar may spend three successes in any phase to roll a single die; success guarantee a demesne forms, with 7s and 8s equaling a minor demesne of appropriate aspect, 9s equaling  a major demesne of appropriate aspect, and a 10 equaling  a major demesne with an aspect specified by the Solar. The Solar may not add more demesnes to a created landmass  than she has spent on upgrades to its area (ie, she must spend two extra successes on increasing land size in order to add an extra demesne). The larger a landmass the Solar is able to create, the more natural resources it will have. The more demesnes it has, the greater the chance it will contain veins of the five magical materials. The Lawgiver may not begin to create very specific land until phase four; she must first generate three phases of non-specific land in order to generate specific land, at which point she starts completely over, losing all generated  land, creatures, and demesnes, generating (Essence x5) square miles in the first phase, and multiplying the preceding area by five in each successive phase until phase seven. In phase seven the area increases as above, at a rate of (Essence x1000) square miles per phase. Increasing square miles in this calculation costs three successes per ten square miles, and the cost of demesne generation is four successes per demesne. With specific land, the Solar can designate the kind of terrain, resources or lack of them, the kind of climate and the kind of denizens. The Solar may specify the aspect of all minor demesnes created by rolls or those that naturally occur at later phases. At phase six, she can designate the kinds of sentient creatures  living in her world, and such creatures will have both positive and negative Intimacies toward her. She has no control over the spirits inducted into her reality, but each that intrudes on her domain at this phase or beyond will automatically have an Intimacy centered on her of the Storyteller’s choosing. Legendary Demesne: Without Charms specifically dedicated  to the creation of legendary demesnes, a Solar must succeed at a phase seven or higher roll for specific land to create a legendary demesne, and she must have at least five major, roll-generated demesnes to do so. If successful , she loses all of her roll-generated demesnes and all minor demesnes, and half her land’s area, to shape a legendary  demesne. She may then start building land mass again at phase one, using the above rules. Mundane Wealth: Creating wealth is a process similar to creating land. Each resources value increase requires that the Solar reach a certain phase by synthesizing appropriate  precursor materials. For example, a silver dirham (worth a bit over Resources 2) is required in order to make five silver talents (Resources 3). At phase one, the Solar can make wealth in excess of Resources  2. Examples of such wealth include a silver dirham, a single well-cut diamond, or half a dozen gold ingots. Extra successes can be used to personalize or specialize such material wealth, giving exquisite, exotic shape and cut to a single diamond or fashioning a number of ingots into jewelry at a rate of two successes per transformation. At phase two, Resources 3 mundane wealth can be created; at phase three, materials in excess of Resources 3 can be created; at phase four, Resources 4 wealth can be created, and at phase five, wealth in excess of Resources 4 but below Resources 5 can be created. A phase six transformation of materials is required to create Resources 5 wealth. Phases in excess of six do not greatly increase the wealth generated  by Wyld-Shaping Technique. Five Magical Materials: In order to create an instance of one of the five magical materials, the Solar must create a minor demesne of the appropriate aspect using the rules above. She may then completely obliviate the land and attached  demesnes in order to create enough ore to process it into a single mina in phase one. A phase two synthesis lets her turn the approximated magical material into a single bar of the same type of material; a phase three synthesis  allows her to create as much as a talent, while a phase four synthesis allows her to create two talents, and so on. It takes approximately five talents of a magical material  to build a grand daiklave. Artifacts and Manses: Artifacts, manses, and certain other wonders require special Charms in order to create with Wyld-Shaping Technique. Everything Else: Wyld-Shaping Technique works through a process of conceptual graduation. In order to raise a fortress, the Solar must first create land to stand it on. The Solar may create anything within the realm of possibility, her logic, or her know-how by following these basic rules. To create a mighty warship, she must raise a cradle to set it on in phase one, or otherwise must have created a body of water to float it in using specific land. The boat is then created in phase two. The deeper into the phases of specific land she goes, the more warships she is able to raise in a single phase, so long as she continues  to grow the body of water with each successive phase. A Solar who spends the effort and experience points to create an ocean can also raise up an armada on its waters. The creation of land can be foregone in instances  where the Solar can conceptualize some other base for beginning her project, such as the cradle for a ship, but the most powerful expressions of Wyld-Shaping Technique work by way of graduating from one concept to the next. It is much easier to create a number of warships  by first creating the waters they sail upon. This process is reversed in order to build even more insane constructs. To raise up marvels such as golem manufactories , the Solar must catabolize something much more powerful, such as a legendary demesne. "

If she creates a medicine hut, her land will produce a shaman-healer, and so on. "

To use this Charm, the Exalt must spend a day studying a subject from an authoritative or definitive source. Her player may then make a pronouncement against an ongoing project based on knowledge her studies reveal, creating bonuses for those who act in accordance with her accurate predictions, and penalties for those who go against them. For example, after reading about the patterns of weather, hostile elemental activity and famine in Jiara during the summer months over the last thousand years, she predicts that Mnemon will not attack Jiaran rebels until fall at the earliest, and will instead spend the summer months consolidating her forces while conserving water and gathering resources for a winter campaign. If Mnemon enacts a project to consolidate her forces while gathering resources until winter, the Storyteller should consider Mnemon ’s project vastly more successful and easier to complete than otherwise. If Mnemon instead decides to invade Jiaran rebel territory in the summer, her invasion will be met with project difficulties, such as resource shortages, elemental attacks, inclement weather, and more specifically, mechanical  penalties to the first War rolls her generals make in the conflict. Conversely, if Mnemon harbors her forces and the Jiaran rebels instead try to attack her, it is their commanders  who will suffer penalties to their opening War rolls. Once the Solar has made a prediction, it may not be canceled  with a conflicting use of this or similar Charms, though it may be counteracted with Sidereal Astrology or similar powerful fate-bending magic. Though this Charm has an instant duration, the motes spent activating it are committed  until the Exalt has had a full night’s rest. "

Two to four extra successes results in a more devastating cataclysm : a tsunami wipes out a fleet of battleships; a series of earthquakes devastate the infrastructures of several cities and roads; a volcano detonates and wipes a city entirely off the map, etc. Five or more extra successes equates to the Solar predicting one of the seven great dooms: a star falls and annihilates a region; a behemoth rises from its slumber and plows through a number of predicted cities; an army of the dead spills from its Shadowland during Calibration to wreak havoc, and so on. The Solar decides what region to research and pronounce doom upon, but the Storyteller decides the nature of the doom she divines based on the result of the roll. The Solar may show mercy by repudiating her pronouncement of devastation at any point before the cataclysm manifests itself, thereby negating her dread prophecy. Though this Charm’s duration is instant, the motes spent activating it are committed for one week if a pronouncement of doom is uttered and allowed to manifest. This Charm may only be used once per year, though it can be reset as often as once per season by paying 12 experience points. "

Regrowth of lost or missing tissues is a much more challenging affair, as is the repair of deformities, Wyld mutation or mental Derangements . However, the Solar’s prowess is such that of these, only Derangements cannot be fully cured. In each case, the Storyteller should decide if the wound, malady or defect is Minor, Major, or Defining. Defining would include paralysis, lost limbs, missing eyes, complete lunacy, and mutations that renders a person completely incapable of a normal human life. The Solar must dedicate four hours a month to treating such conditions through whatever medical means and stunts seem appropriate. This begins an extended roll with a goal of 20, an interval of one month and a difficulty of 5. Under wraps, earth compacts, and acupuncture , a Solar can rebuild the lost tissues of destroyed eyes and missing limbs, and can even aid a target in growing organs that he was born without. Each time the Solar succeeds  at the goal number, the malady decreases in intensity . Once it the goal has been met at the Minor level, a condition  vanishes. Missing limbs are fully regrown, paralysis victims are able to walk, mutations wither and slough away or become easily operable.

An immaterial spirit trapped in the Spirit-Caging Mandala may be perceived by characters  who cannot normally see spirits, and may be struck by characters who cannot normally strike immaterial foes. As the spirit is rendered incapable of moving across range bands, spirits trapped in the cage can only attack characters  outside the diagram if they have the ability to attack at range, and only then if they are attacked first. Foes who enter the mandala at close range are always fair game. "

The Solar must dance for at least two minutes in order to use this Charm, rolling (Charisma + Performance ) with (Essence) automatic successes against the group’s Resolve. If successful, the group is struck with an emotion conveyed by the dance, each member becoming explicitly aware of one Tie he has which inspires that emotion in him. For instance, if the Solar does a dance that inspires fear, characters recall that which makes them most afraid. If she does a dance which inspires joy, they recall that which brings them the most happiness. If characters do not possess such an Intimacy, the Storyteller may assign one. Affected characters will feel inclined to discuss or act upon their feelings until they are affected by emotional influence that inspires a different mood. Characters who reveal an Intimacy in this fashion lower their Guile to 0 for the purposes of detecting and confirming that specific Intimacy. Note that the Solar is not necessarily going to be the beneficiary of the character’s sudden openness, as she might not be directly involved in the conversation. For all her dancing, the Solar is never seen as the deliberate source of the target’s thoughts. Not even All-Encompassing Sorcerous  Sight can reveal the power of this Charm. "

This non-specific effect cannot lower the target’s Resolve by exploiting an Intimacy, nor can the target invoke an Intimacy to raise his defense. If the roll is successful , the target goes catatonic for a moment, allowing the Solar to program him with instructions delivered via (threshold successes +1) short, clear sentences. These instructions  may be complicated as the Solar is able to convey, but all must be carried out at the same time. If the Solar does not use a sentence to designate when the target should act, he will carry out this process immediately. Characters who complete given tasks or take actions on the back of this Charm do not remember why they did such things or even that they were ordered to do them. A character may spend three Willpower to reject the Solar’s programming, but this also results in his completely forgetting  the Solar’s attempt. Characters who resist this Charm by any means cannot be confronted with it again for (target’s Integrity) days. "

The character  may use these successes all on one roll, or may spread them out. Once all the successes have been spent, the Solar senses it, as commitment to the Charm ends. Successes granted by this Charm have certain limitations: • The character may not invoke more successes on an action than he has dots in the relevant Ability. For example, the Solar’s envoy, having Performance 2 and Thrown 1, could apply two successes to his address to the corrupt senate of Paramour, before using his last automatic  success to fling a hidden stiletto into the legate’s neck. He would not be able to put more than one success into the assassination attempt, and each action would have to be done in upholding or advancing a Principle given to him by the Solar. (In this case, perhaps the legate was holding the senate hostage, preventing them from accepting the envoy’s influence.) • This Charm is stackable, but the Solar may not stack it on a single target more than (Essence) times. • Even if the character is benefitting from multiple applications  of this Charm, he may not enhance a single action by more than three granted successes. The Solar may enhance as many characters with this Charm as she has motes to pay the cost. "

Glorious Solar Plate may graft itself over a suit of armor, appearing as a series of interlinked cosmic runes that describe  the ascent of the Unconquered Sun to the zenith of heaven at the birth of the universe. This upgrades the armor’s traits if they are lesser than that of Glorious Solar Plate, and adds the armor-enhancing powers of this Charm to the Lawgiver’s current set. If the Solar’s current armor is attuned, grafting Glorious Solar Plate onto it replaces the commitment cost, releasing the attuned motes. For additional purchases, the player may grant Glorious Solar Plate custom Evocations. The player should work with the Storyteller to create Evocations that exude the nature of the Exalt’s iconic anima manifestation. In addition, Glorious Solar Plate has the following powers: Heavens-Blazing Aura: Against energy-based decisive projectiles such as Blazing Solar Bolt and Flight of the Brilliant Raptor, this armor gains (the greater of Essence or three) decisive soak. This defense applies even when the Solar is crashed. Unbreakable Sustaining Grip: The armor automatically  treats crippling damage to joints and limbs, setting and stabilizing broken bones with binding Essence and channeling  the Solar’s pain out through her anima. As a result, the Solar’s limbs cannot be hacked off and her bones and joints can’t be rendered dysfunctional while she is wearing Glorious Solar Plate. Special activation rules: Glorious Solar Plate is expressly  allowed to be used in combination with Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana, so that a suit of armor can be quickly donned and simultaneously enhanced by this Charm’s effects. Used on its own, Glorious Solar Plate appears already-equipped, perfectly fitted to the Solar’s form. "

In this state the Solar cannot be safely dissuaded from combat. Should friends or allies choose to stand in her way, she won’t slaughter them unheedingly, but will use any force necessary to remove them from her path so she can continue to assault her original target. She will not, and cannot end her assault until her targets are dead or fled, and if she is convinced by an impassioned plea to drop her commitment to this Charm, she will go into immediate Initiative crash. If she crashes herself in this fashion, her Initiative is set to -3. Ending this Charm while already crashed does not change the Solar’s Initiative value.

Against any attack which might knock her from her mount, she gains +1 Defense. Horse-Summoning Whistle: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to call a loyal mount to her side. The mount makes its way to her as circumstances best allow. Master Horseman’s Eye: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively when evaluating a mount to perfectly recognize  its strengths and weaknesses. Speed-Sustaining Technique: The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively and touch a mount to sustain it for two hours. Effort during that time does not exhaust the creature, and it does not suffer harmful random incidents such as thrown shoes and injured hooves. Spirit-Steadying Assurances: The Solar can spend one mote reflexively to stop a mount from panicking. For one instant, the mount shakes off all natural or supernatural fear, and may not be intimidated by direct effort for (Essence) rounds, or indirect circumstances for the scene’s duration. Blood Rider’s Toughness: The Solar and her mount are as a single being with one skin.

The Exalt’s anima must be at the bonfire level to use this Charm. The moment the Solar activates this Charm, her iconic anima crawls up the mast, rendering it invincible to all damage for an instant. If the sails are still flying, her anima crawls over them, suffusing them and igniting them in a massive display that can be seen for (Essence * 5) miles. If the sails are gone, the Lawgiver’s anima flies in their place, restoring the ship’s sail-based speed. While the Burning Anima Sails are flying, the ship is supernaturally terrifying to demons, the undead, and other benighted creatures from the recesses  of Creation. All naval maneuvers attempted by such creatures suffer a dice penalty equal to half the Lawgiver’s Essence, rounded up. In addition, any creatures of darkness  who board the Solar’s ship suffer a -1 penalty to all actions. Using this Charm drops the Solar to the dim anima level. When the Charm ends, the iconic anima dissipates, leaving the ship’s fabric sails perfectly restored, even if they were completely destroyed. "

The Solar may invoke this Charm when a character pierces her Guile, supplying a false purpose for her true motives. If the initiate inquires as to one of her Intimacies, and manages to uncover one, she may also use this Charm to misdirect his interpretation , changing the context of a Tie or the wording of a Principle to mislead him. This causes the initiate to make incorrect assumptions about the Solar’s loyalties, interests or objectives, causing his social influence against her to be less effective or completely implausible. For example, he might discern that she is a devotee of the Immaculate Faith when in reality she holds the Order in contempt. His persuasion  to get her to aid the Order by informing on her fellow Solars would then experience a boost in her Resolve, rather than a weakening. Though this Charm is paid instantly , the Solar’s false Intimacy lingers until the end of the story. She is not compelled by this Intimacy and may freely act against it, nor is her Resolve lowered through its exploitation. However, should she experience Limit Break before the end of the story, the Intimacy becomes real, capable of influencing her until the story ends. "

The Storyteller then must truthfully  affirm or deny the accuracy of the player’s speculation. This Charm does not guarantee success, but allows the Solar to piece together a clearer picture of a target by association  or at least elimination.

If the roll succeeds, the target’s intended social action—be it to persuade , bargain, threaten, instill, or read intentions—is treated as if it has already failed and must be reset (p. 223). This Charm is capable of defining influence without employing  an Intimacy, but carries no inherent power to lower a target’s Resolve on its own.

Once a character has been hit with this Charm, if he successfully resets his social action or he pays Willpower to resist, this Charm can no longer prevent him from attempting the social influence he was initially denied.

To characters whose Resolve is beaten by this roll, the Lawgiver’s claim appears to be true: when the target interacts with affected characters, his social actions are penalized by twice the Solar’s Essence score in dice, with botches inevitably reflecting the truth of the Solar’s words. Affected characters may pay one Willpower to resist this influence, but that still does not remove the curse. The target must either present direct evidence with a successful persuade action to each individual member in order to cancel the effect, or leave the group for (Solar’s Essence) days—when he returns he’ll no longer suffer the Charm’s penalty, but will still suffer the effects of the group turned against him, which he can counter with normal influence. This Charm can only be used on a single character  once per story. "

            "Description": "Gripping her foe like a vice, the Lawgiver’s penetrating gaze opens a rift into her target’s soul, allowing her to hide there. This technique requires the Lawgiver be in control of a grapple, after which she must then successfully execute a (Dexterity + Stealth) roll which surpasses her target’s Resolve, with a number of automatic successes equal to the Exalt’s Essence and a number of bonus dice equal to half the remaining rounds of clinch control, rounded down. If successful, the Solar appears to step into her target’s shadow and bleed away. The Solar takes possession of her target’s senses and motor functions, and can make her victim act against a negative Intimacy or act against something to which he has a positive Minor Intimacy without contest. If the Solar attempts to make her host act against a Major or Defining Intimacy, use the social influence system as normal, though the subject can terminate this Charm by successfully resisting such influence. Abstract Intimacies such as “I refuse to be controlled” or “I cannot be forced to take action” are not valid for the purpose of this Charm— when resolving the effects of Shadow Replacement Technique , treat such Intimacies as nonexistent. (See also the “Intimacies and Roleplaying” sidebar, p. 172.) Unlike other forms of control, a Solar can use Shadow Replacement  Technique to force a victim to harm or even kill himself; however, the Solar is subject to damage equal to any suffered by her subject while in possession. While this Charm is active, Vanishing from Mind’s Eye Method can be targeted to the host alone, and costs only five motes to activate. Shadow Replacement Technique still works on targets that do not have a shadow. Replacing someone’s shadow counts as being concealed within full cover for the purposes  of Shadow-Crossing Leap Technique. "

Roll the Solar’s (Dexterity + Stealth) against her attacker’s (Perception + Awareness). If she succeeds, she slips out of sight and into concealment , evading the attack as if she had dodged it. If she succeeds with at least one 10 in her result, she enters stealth while her opponent strikes an afterimage left by the Solar’s anima, transferring the damage result harmlessly away from the Solar and returning her opponent  to base Initiative. The Solar may leave an object concealed within her anima to receive the strike, reducing  the Charm cost by one mote—two if the player makes a clever substitution. At Essence 5+, forcing an attacker down to base Initiative with this Charm nets the Solar a temporary point of Willpower. "

In addition, for every hour the Solar continues to use this Charm, the Solar works toward a climactic encounter with the rawest expression of survivalist skill possible. This guarantees that after repeated use, the Solar will have at least one chance per day to catch a large fish, kill a game animal, trap a large bird or find a fruit-bearing tree.

No influence of any kind—other than that of the Solar—can make the familiar act against this Intimacy. Essence-Drawing Method: The familiar becomes a font of spiritual energy.

If the Exalt taps more than five motes from multiple pets in a scene, the motes she draws will only last until her next turn. Power-Renewing Bond: The Solar draws strength from her familiar bond. Once per day, through interaction with her familiar, the Exalt may draw a single point of Willpower  as a simple action lasting at least a few seconds. This contact renews the Solar’s mental energies and can even negate a -1 crippling penalty to the Exalt’s social influence  actions. The Solar may only use this power once per day, no matter how many familiars she has.

This simple action requires the Solar to concentrate  on pushing her consciousness into the mind of her familiar, rendering her incapable of taking any other actions until she has returned to her own mind. This power can be invoked when the character is asleep or otherwise inactive, and has no known range limitation.

Through exercise and repeated practice, she can also train the beast to use special abilities that are latent, such as an eagle’s disarm ability (p. 563), or techniques designed by the player or the Storyteller  which are appropriate to the animal. Normally, training an animal to unlock its latent potential  requires a minimum of Survival 3, and two specialties : one in animal husbandry, and another specific to the animal—falconry for a hawk, lion taming for a great cat, and so on. The trainer makes an extended roll with an interval of one month and a goal of 10, modified by the animal’s attitude—docile and tamed beasts presenting  no penalties, familiars representing a number of bonus dice equal to the trainer’s Intimacy to the animal, and hostile, wild, or otherwise untrainable animals representing  a penalty of -2 or -3. The trainer must spend the entire month interacting with the beast, teaching it words, signals, commands, and running it through exercises daily. Any significant amount of time the trainer spends away from the beast during this time saps successes away at a rate of one success for every two or three days. Success at the extended roll means that the animal learns to use the technique and can be order to do so on command. A Solar with Beast-Mastering Behavior gains (Essence) automatic successes to this roll, and shortens the interval of the roll to one week. Using this Charm exempts her from the specialty requirements of normal training, while the Charm Friendship with Animals Approach may eliminate  the penalty associated with wild or hostile animals. At Survival 5+, Essence 3+, the Solar can teach a familiar she has enhanced with Spirit-Tied Pet to use magical abilities , such as the eagle’s special ability Iron Wings Carry. Doing so costs the Solar two experience points per ability trained.The player and the Storyteller can work together to develop new and appropriate abilities for the Solar to teach her familiar. Also at Survival 5+, Essence 3+, the Exalt can use Beast- Mastering Behavior on a familiar she has enhanced with Bestial Traits Technique, to teach it to use a special ability that it can only use during Deadly Predator Method, for a cost of two experience points. Such abilities need not be wholly appropriate for the animal in question. A flying squirrel might gain the power to generate a charge like an electric eel, while a tyrant lizard might learn to spit a fireball from its mouth. "

Her surroundings become primal, shifting in modes and methods unseen since the dawn of time, and her familiar remembers an ancient time and an earlier form in which beasts were the life that beat at the heart of a supreme being. Channeling the Essence of the ancient world through her familiar, the Solar’s honored companion is transformed into a primal beast of war. Deadly Predator Method has the following advantages: • The familiar grows immense. Its size grows by 15%, and an additional 10% for every repurchase of Life of the Aurochs. The Solar may waive the growth bonus if she chooses. • The familiar’s appearance becomes magnificent and terrifying . Its markings become more extreme, its colors explosive and vibrant. Natural armor such as a shell or carapace becomes spiked and ridged, while natural weaponry  such as horns, fangs and tusks grow even more pronounced . The familiar gains (Solar’s Essence) automatic  successes to intimidate targets. Against much smaller or cowardly opponents, the familiar is automatically intimidating —such enemies suffer a -1 penalty to their attacks against the familiar. • The familiar cannot be intimidated, and ignores all fearinducing  magic. • The familiar gains (Solar’s Essence) automatic successes  to all movement-based Athletics rolls. Mighty familiars  such as bears and boars gain (Solar’s Essence) in successes on (Strength + Athletics) rolls. Gigantic familiars  gain all of these advantages and increase their minimum strength by (Solar’s Essence x2) for the purposes  of which feats of strength they can attempt. • The familiar’s withering and decisive attacks gain (Solar’s Essence) automatic successes. The creature’s withering damage gains a bonus equal to the Solar’s Essence. For the duration of the Charm, its Initiative does not reset on a successful decisive attack unless the Solar uses Red-Toothed Execution Order. • The familiar’s hide grows tough as iron, its bones as hard as diamond, its flesh like granite. It gains five soak against withering attacks, and it becomes invulnerable to decisive attacks. During this time, the transformed familiar can only be hurt by falling from extreme heights or by being crushed by massive vertical tonnage. Even so, such damage will not exceed the familiar’s final health box, leaving it incapacitated but alive when the Charm ends. • The familiar may roll Join Battle upon transformation, keeping the higher of its current value or the roll’s result. Smaller animals that do not usually attack gain dice pools comparable to smaller predators and can use appropriate  special attacks associated with such animals. For example, a hummingbird gains access to the eagle’s Death Dive attack (see p. 563). Familiars enhanced with Beast-Mastering Behavior may also gain access to a special ability denoted in that’s Charm’s text. While Deadly Predator Method is active, the familiar loses one point of Initiative per round, and if it suffers Initiative  crash, Deadly Predator Method ends, and the beast reverts to its mundane form. Deadly Predator Method can only be used once per battle, but can be reset by killing an opponent with Red-Toothed Execution Order. "

For one mote, one Willpower, she may use this Charm to benefit a disarm gambit in exactly the same manner. With either use of the Charm, the Lawgiver’s first weapon forces the target to parry or dodge, creating an opening for the second attack to strike, but this does not create an additional onslaught penalty. For one mote, one Willpower, the Exalt may also use this Charm to reflexively clash a close or ranged attack, though without the reroll effect. The Solar may choose to disarm her opponent on a successful strike—a technique called Shadow Wind Slash—or she may direct her second blade at the target’s vital points for decisive damage, a technique  called Shadow Wind Kill. The clash version of this Charm can only be used once per scene, but can be reset by using Steel Storm Descending to successfully damage an opponent. At Essence 5+, the Lawgiver may pay three motes on a successful clash to direct one weapon into her target’s hand and the other into his neck (or other exposed regions), both disarming and doing decisive damage.
