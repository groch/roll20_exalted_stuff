The more extensive the transformation, the more onerous the task that must be fulfilled: • Transformations that could at least notionally be accomplished by mundane means and that don’t hold great personal significance to the questant require an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216).

Examples include physically transitioning genders, making someone grow significantly taller, or turning a mortal into a bear. • Supernatural transformations on the level of what a Celestial Circle working could accomplish require a life-defining task. This can also include transformations that completely change the nature  of a supernatural being, which normally requires  a Solar Circle working. Examples include undoing a decade or two of aging, turning a demon  into a god, or turning a raksha into a human. Upon the quest’s completion, the questant undergoes the chosen transformation as a shaping effect. Sometimes this is sudden and spectacular; sometimes, it is subtle, the culmination of a gradual metamorphosis the questant  didn’t even realize had begun.

Against the leader, the Lunar can convince him to engage her in a physical contest without needing to leverage a supporting Intimacy: a duel, an archery competition, a race, etc. However, this benefit doesn’t apply for contests  that are obviously one-sided or so dangerous as to be nigh-suicidal.

The Lunar makes an opposed (Intelligence + [Lore or Occult]) roll against someone who can hear and understand  her (or can otherwise perceive and understand the riddle, such as if she uses Glance-Oration Technique to convey it through body language).

As part of this project, the Lunar must spread word of her shrine among the community, teaching them the rites that must be performed there. Once the Lunar completes her shrine, the community’s people may invoke her favor and protection by performing  the shrine’s rites. The shrine’s rites can take many forms, but always require  a community member to travel to the shrine no less than once a year at Calibration. The Lunar also imposes  additional requirements whose severity depends on how much of the community must be involved to meet them. If a majority of its populace is required, their obligation need only be an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216), like observing a dietary restriction or praying to the Lunar. If a smaller group is necessary, it must be at least a serious task, like making lavish offerings of animal sacrifices. If only the person who travels to the shrine is necessary, it must be a life-changing task, like killing a lion alone and bringing its carcass to the shrine. As long as the rites are performed, the community gains the following benefits. They extend out to (Essence x10) miles from the center of the community proper. • The Lunar can hear any prayers made to her from the shrine.

It doesn’t undo corruption that’s already taken place. • Spirits and fae within the community count as having a Minor Principle of respect for its customs .
