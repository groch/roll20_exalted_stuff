Resisting this influence requires him to cite at least a Major Intimacy in a Decision Point and spend (Lunar’s Essence) Willpower. Against the leader’s followers, any Ties they have to him — positive or negative — count as supporting this influence. Affected characters must watch this contest without disturbing or interrupting it. If time allows, they’ll try to convince as many people as possible to watch with them, adding (Lunar’s Essence) dice on persuade rolls to do so. Nontrivial characters can resist this influence for one Willpower, or two Willpower if they wish to interfere with the contest. If the Lunar successfully influences the leader and subsequently  wins the contest, she breaks his will. She rolls (Essence) dice. The leader loses that many Willpower, which the Lunar gains. She may opt to lose points of Limit in place of gaining that much Willpower. The leader forms a Defining Tie toward the Lunar, with a context chosen by his player — whether he respects her or hates her, she looms large in his life. Winning by cheating is valid if the Lunar isn’t caught. If any onlookers have positive Ties to the leader, the Lunar becomes the object of those Intimacies, displacing his place in his loyal subject’s hearts. Anyone with a negative  Tie to the leader gains a positive Tie of equal intensity  to the Lunar, with a context chosen by their player. Reset: This can’t be used against the same character more than once per story.","charm-rollexpr":""}],"Charisma - Warfare":[{"attr-mins":{"charisma":2,"essence":1},"prereq":[],"charm-skill":"Charisma - Warfare","charm-name":"Pack Leader Attitude","charm-type":"Supplemental","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"2m","rep-cost-mote":2,"rep-cost-will":0,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Lunars","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Archetype (Strength)","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"The Lunar roars over the din of battle to lead her forces .

She claims a single contiguous region no more than (Essence x 10) square miles as her territory. To do so, she must fully master the land she wishes to claim. She must physically traverse the majority of the region. Any mortal communities living in the territory must accept her presence — they need not make her their leader, but must acknowledge her presence and that they lack the ability or desire to force her out. Finally, if any supernatural beings — such as spirits or fellow Exalted — occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Lunar must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge. Land already claimed by another Lunar’s Boundary- Marking Meditation can’t be taken from him unless he voluntarily relinquishes it or dies. Upon claiming a territory, the Lunar’s player chooses three qualities that describe it, e.g. fertile, shadowy, and dense for a thick forest, or open, windy, and guarded for a steppe village. When a character within the territory takes an action that’s supported by any of these qualities, like foraging in a fertile woodland, he’s treated as having an applicable specialty. When a character takes an action opposed by a quality, like a general enacting a Strategic Maneuver roll to march a large army through the dense forest, each such quality  imposes a −1 penalty. The Lunar never suffers these penalties. She can reflexively render a character she perceives immune to her territory’s penalties, or deny him its benefits. Story events may cause a territory to lose qualities — if the forest burns down, it’s no longer shadowy or dense. Once per story, the Lunar may change a territory’s qualities, replacing lost qualities and potentially swapping  existing qualities for new ones as fits the story.

When the Lunar suffers decisive damage within a territory, she may divert up to half that damage, rounded down, into that territory’s health track. Alternatively, she may negate a botch or loss of Willpower from a disease while in a territory at the cost of one level of damage to it. Damage to the Lunar’s territory manifests as withered plants, barren soil, disease-ridden animals, etc. The territory ’s wound penalty is imposed on Survival rolls to forage or find shelter within it, and Craft rolls to create objects from its natural resources. The territory heals one level of damage each month. If it’s enhanced by Moon-and-Earth Blessing, it heals one level of damage each week, but Moon-and-Earth Blessing’s bonus successes don’t apply while the territory’s −1 levels or deeper are damaged. While in a territory, the Lunar may forgo healing one level of damage in her own health track to heal a level in the territory’s health track. At the Storyteller’s discretion , this can also undo blights, infestations, or curses upon the land. If a territory’s health track is completely undamaged and it’s enhanced by Moon-and-Earth Blessing, the Lunar may forgo healing levels of damage  in her health track to increase Moon-and-Earth Blessing’s bonus to four automatic successes for a number  of weeks equal to the levels of healing she forgoes.

The Lunar spends five days laboring  to create a testing ground in a demesne or the Wyld: meditating, performing austerities, bargaining with spirits, etching occult geoglyphs, etc. It’s imbued with the Essence of the Lunar’s spirit shape; a mortal who successfully completes  its trial receives six dots of mutations reflecting that animal, chosen by the Lunar when she uses this Charm. Lunars with Chimera-Soul Expression (p. 143) choose two sets of mutations per trial ground, reflecting both animals making up their spirit shape; successful participants receive whichever best fits their personality and their triumph’s nature. These mutations are hereditary, letting Lunars establish great beastfolk lineages. The Lunar doesn’t choose the trial’s nature; it emerges from her spirit shape’s nature and the Essence of the demesne or the Wyld. Her player should work with the Storyteller to determine what form the trial takes. It might be a challenge of physical, social, or mental prowess; a test of character or Intimacies; or an ordeal with no single solution. Whatever form it takes, failure carries significant consequences — not necessarily death, but maiming, curses, Derangements, and other afflictions are all possible. A character can only attempt  a single such trial ever, pass or fail — she can’t subsequently benefit from other trial grounds, even those created by different Lunars. These factors limit the creation of beastfolk en masse. If the Lunar ends this Charm before the story she used it in ends, the testing ground loses its power. Once the story ends, the testing ground becomes permanent, no longer requiring committed motes and persisting past the Lunar’s death. However, testing grounds can be destroyed by building manses over their demesnes, or by permanently shaping the Wyld containing them into Creation with magic such as Wyld-Shaping Technique. (Harmony-With-Reality Technique won’t destroy testing grounds.) A Lunar can’t have more than (Intelligence + Willpower) permanent testing grounds.

As she channels bestial Essence, she might exhibit fits of animalistic behavior, uncontrolled shapeshifting, or glossolalia in the secret tongues of beasts. At the ritual ’s culmination, the primal force inhabiting the Lunar emerges as a beast-spirit, a divine personification of that animal. The Lunar loses the shape the spirit was born from. She can’t choose her spirit shape; there can be no greater embodiment of it than her. None would mistake a beast-spirit for an ordinary animal . Some are humanoid in form, or have a human’s face or a human-like mask in place of a bestial visage. Some have multiple eyes, tails, limbs, or even heads. They have intelligence comparable to a human’s. A beast-spirit uses the same traits as its animal form, plus the below: • It’s a spirit, rather than an animal. It’s naturally material, but can dematerialize, using the same rules as materializing (Exalted, p. 510), but in reverse. If slain, it reforms at the Lunar’s side on the next full moon. • It’s the Lunar’s familiar. • It has Essence 3 and a pool of (50 + [Essence x10]) motes. • It has a Defining Tie of loyalty to the Lunar, which can’t be weakened or altered by any means. Upon creation, it has one other Defining Intimacy and two Major Intimacies, typically reflecting some aspects of its animal’s instincts, behavior, or socialization. • It knows Hurry Home (Exalted, p. 509), allowing it to return to the Lunar, and (Lunar’s Essence) additional spirit Charms appropriate to its animal ’s nature, the symbolic significance it has to the Lunar, or the beast-spirit’s changed form.

The Lunar creates a shrine, monument, cairn, or similar site in a place that’s close to a community, but set apart from it — a forest bordering a village, a mountain peak that looms above a mining town, First Age ruins beneath a city, etc. This requires at least a major Craft project (Exalted, p. 240). As part of this project, the Lunar must spread word of her shrine among the community, teaching them the rites that must be performed there. Once the Lunar completes her shrine, the community’s people may invoke her favor and protection by performing  the shrine’s rites. The shrine’s rites can take many forms, but always require  a community member to travel to the shrine no less than once a year at Calibration. The Lunar also imposes  additional requirements whose severity depends on how much of the community must be involved to meet them. If a majority of its populace is required, their obligation need only be an inconvenient task (Exalted, p. 216), like observing a dietary restriction or praying to the Lunar. If a smaller group is necessary, it must be at least a serious task, like making lavish offerings of animal sacrifices. If only the person who travels to the shrine is necessary, it must be a life-changing task, like killing a lion alone and bringing its carcass to the shrine. As long as the rites are performed, the community gains the following benefits. They extend out to (Essence x10) miles from the center of the community proper. • The Lunar can hear any prayers made to her from the shrine. If she knows Fleeting Silver Mirage (Lunars, p. 295), she can use it in response to a prayer to appear at the shrine. • The community is warded against the encroachment  of the Wyld, shadowlands, and similar forms of corruption. This includes all environmental Shaping effects. It doesn’t undo corruption that’s already taken place. • Spirits and fae within the community count as having a Minor Principle of respect for its customs . They can’t attempt to harm community members or refuse to hear out their requests, so long as the community treats them peacefully and inoffensively. Characters whose Essence equals or exceeds the Lunar’s may pay one Willpower to resist this for a scene, or two Willpower to harm community members unprovoked. • If the Lunar knows Heaven-Darkening Eclipse or Unraveling the Tapestry (Lunars, p. 206), she senses whenever the community comes under that from magic that could be negated with that Charm, letting her use it from afar. If she succeeds , the solution she introduces is revealed to the community’s members by dreams, strange portents, or spiritual ecstasies.

If the player of the influencing character doesn’t consent to this, the Lunar’s instill roll is subject to the rules for overturning influence (Exalted, p. 221), and fails entirely if she can’t overturn the opposing influence. Instilled Intimacies and inspired emotions remain, though the victim doesn’t realize they’re the result of another’s influence. If someone reminds the victim of the scene’s events, or he finds evidence that time has passed without his awareness, he may resist this influence for three Willpower, regaining his memories. Terminated influence  resumes, while reset actions must be reset again, if characters haven’t already attempted them. This Charm can only be used once per day. Once the Lunar uses this Charm against a character, he’s immune  to further uses for (his Integrity) days.","charm-rollexpr":""},{"attr-mins":{"manipulation":5,"essence":3},"prereq":["Cobra’s Hypnotic Gaze","Herd"],"charm-skill":"Manipulation - Influence","charm-name":"Shadow Faith Inversion","charm-type":"Supplemental","charm-duration":"Instant","charm-cost":"8m, 1wp","rep-cost-mote":8,"rep-cost-will":1,"rep-cost-init":0,"charm-short-desc":"","charm-book":"Lunars","charm-aspect":"","charm-mute":"","charm-balanced":"","charm-can-cycle-aspects":0,"charm-keywords":"Protean, Psyche","charm-description":"","charm-effect":"Subversion Approach The Lunar’s words poison the soul, twisting the heart against itself.

If she succeeds, she prevents him from noticing one thing present in the scene — a character, object, natural feature, etc. Inanimate things that span more than a single range band can’t be concealed. The Lunar must continue speaking to maintain this concealment, doing so as a reflexive action on each of her turns. If the Lunar prevents her victim from noticing another character, this functions as though that character had successfully made a Stealth roll to establish concealment  against her victim, including the potential to make surprise attacks.

She gains its heart’s blood as a retroactive sacred hunt, and must pay the cost to shapeshift into it, muting the cost. This can only be used to replace narratively unimportant  characters, and never powerful beings such as Exalted or spirits — in a scene set at a prince’s court, the Lunar couldn’t replace the prince, one of his trusted viziers, or the captain of the palace guard, but could replace a servant or a rank-and-file guard. She couldn’t declare that the rogue yeddim stampeding through Nexus is actually her, but could reveal that she’s been the songbird singing from a tree, or a fly buzzing around a satrap’s meal (assuming she has Emerald Grasshopper Form).

Only Eye of the Unconquered Sun or similarly mighty magic can reveal her. If the Lunar initiates hostilities after using this Charm, she may potentially launch an ambush (Exalted, p. 203). This Charm represents the Lunar’s deft skill at infiltration  and impersonation. If the Storyteller deems it implausible for her to appear in a scene — for example, if it’s set in a fortress whose guards are on the lookout for shapeshifters, or the manse of a Dragon-Blood with potent Awareness and Investigation Charms — he may require a (Manipulation + [Larceny, Socialize, or Stealth]) roll against an appropriate difficulty to succeed, maximum 10.

On a failed roll, she’s unable to enter the scene. Even if successful, she must still explain how she’s insinuated herself into it. However, assuming the Lunar succeeds on the roll and contrives an appropriate  explanation, there are no circumstances whereby it’s truly impossible for her to infiltrate a scene as long as a viable candidate for replacement is present. This Charm can only be used once per story. An Essence 5 repurchase requires False Moonrise Phantasm, and lets the Lunar pay a fifteen-mote, one-Willpower surcharge to use this Charm in scenes where she’s already present.

The Lunar can’t take the usual special grapple actions, but doesn’t suffer any penalties. A trapped character can spend his entire turn to reduce the clinch’s rounds of control by two. Likewise, a character that spends her entire turn assisting the victim subtracts  two rounds of control. Attacking or damaging the Lunar doesn’t subtract rounds of control.
